A geographer speaks as though his knowledge of space and place were derived exclusively from books, maps, aerial photographs, and structured field surveys. He writes as though people were endowed with mind and vision and no other sense with which to apprehend the world and find meaning in it. He and the architect-planner tend to assume familiarity---the fact that we are oriented in space and at home in place---rather than describe and try to understand what "being-in-the-world" is truly like.\footnote{Yi--Fu Tuan, \textit{Space and Place: The Perspective of Experience} (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1997): 200--201.}

The subtle, intangible, but soul-deep mix of landscape, smells, sounds, history . . . that constitute a place, a homeland.\footnote{Charles Wilkinson, \textit{The Eagle Bird: Mapping a New West} (New York: Pantheon, 1992), 137--138.}

From his home in the Santa Cruz foothills, Wallace Stegner lamented the changes occurring to the Santa Clara Valley in 1965. The Stanford creative writing professor condemned the urban sprawl that had overtaken the former farmland. "The orchards that used to be a spring garden of bloom down the long trough of the Santa Clara Valley," he wrote, "have gone under so fast that a person absent for five years could return and think himself in another country. . . . The once--lovely coast hills reaching down the Peninsula below San Francisco have been crusted with houses in half a lifetime, the hilltops flattened, whole hills carried off to fill the bay, the creeks turned into concrete storm drains."[^cf3] In Stegner's lifetime, the Valley had transformed from prime agricultural land to a place known for urban sprawl, traffic jams, and manufacturing facilities. Stegner felt so betrayed by the changes to the land that he wished to be buried not in California---the place that had so deeply shaped his writing and identity---but in his summer home of Vermont.[^cf4]

Like many living in the Santa Clara Valley, Stegner was a newcomer to this place. Born in 1909 in north-central Iowa, he came to California to teach in the creative writing program at Stanford University. In Stegner's imagination the Santa Clara Valley had fallen far from its once pristine grace. He wrote of "a park-like oak forest reaching southward from a clean bay" when the Ohlone people occupied the region. "The climate was mild and benevolent," Stegner wrote of this place, "the bay full of shellfish. The creeksides tangles grew wild berries and the oaks provided the wherewithal for unlimited acorn flour." He not only celebrated this imagined pre-European landscape, but the post-European one as well. As fields of wheat and fruit groves planted by Spanish missionaries began to transform the Bay Area into an agricultural landscape, Stegner celebrated these as "a glory" in which pears, prunes, apricots, cherry blossoms, and apples were an improvement to the land. "This brief Eden," as Stegner referred to the Valley, fell to the original sin of industrialization.^[William S. Cooper, "Vegetational Development upon Alluvial Fans in the Vicinity of Palo Alto, CA," *Ecology* 7 (January 1927): 11.] <!-- {TODO: check this footnote? He's not quoting Stegner here. } -->

Frederick E. Terman interpreted the landscape differently. The Stanford University provost and dean of engineering---often referred to as the "Father of Silicon Valley"---saw suburbanization and expansion of industry in the Santa Clara Valley not as signs of degradation, but rather signposts towards a new prosperous future for Stanford, for Santa Clara County, for California, and for the nation. The newly--founded Stanford Industrial Park and the lands around the university, rather than seen as encroaching sprawl, were, in the words of one booster, a "pleasant place" of "broad lawns, employee patios, trees, flowers and shrubs, walls of glass, recreational clubs" that stood in contrast to the "smoke--stacks, noise, coal cars, soot and other things" found in the industrial East and Midwest.[^cf5] The landscape appeared campus--like and suburban, amenities that reflected the values of Stanford and surrounding suburban communities. Although complaints of traffic and air pollution had become common by the mid--1960s, Terman dismissed these complaints. The Industrial Park had done much for the Bay Area's economy, and Terman felt congestion and air pollution were "really a pretty small price to pay."[^cf6]

These competing visions of the Santa Clara Valley landscape reflected widely-held and conflicting ideas about the future of the Valley. Silicon Valley represented a new feature of the American West, an economic and political project marrying a pastoral idealism with the building a new high tech urbanism. In the face of postwar residential growth and industrial development, the Santa Clara Valley's landscape changed remarkably. The arrival of machines in the Valley---bulldozers and computers---transformed the landscape, and in the process sparked discussions about creating an idealized high-tech metropolitan region that balanced a vision of the California Dream with the high tech suburbs.

The engineers, scientists, academics, and other knowledge professionals who congregated into the suburbs led to a convergence of ideals and attitudes about natural beauty, open space, livable and sustainable cities, and access to leisure. These political causes animated both liberals and conservatives, who could find common ground---if not common goals---for their region. The San José city council Republican Virginia Shaffer, for instance, based her anti-growth politics off homeowner interests---levying criticism against inadequate city services, rising tax burdens for suburbanites, as well as the rapid pace of growth for growth's sake. Less than ten years after Shaffer's election, Democrat Janet Gray Hayes' ascent to the San José mayor's office reflected a continued criticism of the city's growth orientation. These suburbanites catalyzed grassroots environmental political activity for a range of causes, rooted in a belief that their region was unique among the nation's high-tech suburbs. Activists who got their start in the fair housing movement of the 1950s found themselves becoming open space advocates by the 1960s, arguing that these places mattered for creating livable and equitable cities. Open space and environmental movements organized throughout the Peninsula, reacting to changes in the land by working through traditional channels of political power. Their activity was felt through many policies and laws later adopted by the federal, state, and regional governments, including stricter regulations on high-tech pollutants and open space and growth control laws.^[On the emergence of environmentalism from within American suburbs, see [@sellers2012crucible]; [@rome2001bulldozer]; [@arnold1971newdeal];[@highsmith2015flint].]

These causes reflected, primarily, the class identity and priorities of affluent suburban liberals. These suburban environmentalists enjoyed what they did---their affluent homes, exclusive communities, means to access and enjoy leisure and open space, jobs at research and development labs---because of federal politics emerging from pro-growth New Deal liberalism and the Cold War military-industrial-academic complex. While environmental activists achieved many victories, their failings underline the political forces that constrained their activities. Furthermore, their neglect, willful or otherwise, of issues surrounding race and gender highlights the limits of their vision for a high tech urbanism predicated on freedom from the problems decaying postwar American cities.^[On the decline of American cities, see [@fogelson2001downtown]; [@sugrue1996crisis].] Environmental campaigns to offer quality-of-life benefits largely served the affluent suburbs rather than the inner cities or barrios. Silicon Valley's small yet influential populations of Latinos, African Americans, and Asian Americans dealt with a different side of Silicon Valley---one far more segregated, discriminatory, polluted, and hazardous to human health.

![The boundaries of Silicon Valley.](figures/sv_outline_study.png)

The story told here is about a particular place and an expression of environmental politics. I do not venture into efforts of the San Francisco Bay's conservation, fights over the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) transportation system, or open space battles beyond Santa Clara County. My focus is on a specific valley, the Santa Clara Valley, where the core of Silicon Valley was founded and expanded. The "where" of Silicon Valley is slightly harder to define, undergoing continuous reshaping since its beginnings in the 1940s as high technology firms expanded throughout Santa Clara, San Mateo, and San Francisco counties on the Peninsula. I define Silicon Valley by its economic and industrial activity in semiconductor plants, microcomputer manufacturing, and software development. The borders of Silicon Valley today could easily extend northward into San Francisco, whose high-tech industry is rapidly growing, and as far south as Morgan Hill and as far east as Fremont or Oakland. But for the majority of the history examined ahead, the bulk of high tech industrial activity largely occurred in Santa Clara County. For the purposes of this study, Silicon Valley is largely bounded by Palo Alto in the northern end of Santa Clara County to San José in the southern end of the county (see Figure 1). Between and including these two cities the greatest concentrations of high tech manufacturing took place, and it is here the landscape changed so dramatically.^[I am comprising a database of Silicon Valley tech companies between 1940 and 1990, which currently numbers close to 2,000 companies culled from archival sources, city directories, and industrial pamphlets and guidebooks. The bulk of these companies are located in the northern end of Santa Clara County. See Chapter 2 for more discussion about the spread and location of these companies. The full database is online at <https://github.com/hepplerj/machinesvalley/blob/gh-pages/data-files/sv-companies/sv_companies.csv>.]

The study ahead is largely focused on local history. Yet it also attempts to examine these changes at various scales: neighborhood, city, region, and nation. Heeding Andrew Needham's call that the history of suburbanization must look beyond cities to understand how suburban growth affected places beyond their borders, I suggest we best understand the history of Silicon Valley not only from its unique local contexts but also by seeing how the Valley shaped both regional and national political trends. Although any one of the cities of Santa Clara County---which numbered 14 municipal corporations by the 1990s---would work well for analyzing the trends in environmental politics, by thinking about these changes as a regional level reveals how metropolitan place shaped one another across space. In Silicon Valley, several centers of high tech activity emerged to serve new businesses and their affluent employees---Palo Alto, San José, Santa Clara, Mountain View, Sunnyvale.

Silicon Valley became a gold standard for its suburban form, cited by journalists, scholars, critics, and pundits throughout the country as an example of a friendly business climate, suburban paradise, and economic powerhouse. Places as varied as Atlanta, Georgia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Cleveland, Ohio, Omaha, Nebraska, Bangalore, India, Mission Hills in the Guandong Province of China, and Shenzhen, China, have all looked to Silicon Valley as a vision for their futures---going so far as to model their architectural designs after the Spanish villa and ranch aesthetic of Stanford University. Across the United States, places borrow the "Silicon" moniker to describe the "Silicon Forest" of Oregon, the "Silicon Desert" of Arizona and the Southwest, and "Silicon Prairie" to variously describe Midwestern states, Texas, or Wyoming---markers of place meant to represent regions grounded in high tech.^[See, for example, Margaret O'Mara, "Silicon Valleys," *Boom: A Journal of California* 1 (Summer 2011) <http://www.boomcalifornia.com/2011/06/silicon-valleys/>; Gordon B. Dodds and Craig E. Wollner, *Silicon Forest: High Tech in the Portland Area, 1945--1986* (Portland: Oregon Historical Society Press, 2000); [@mayer2005tektronix]; [@webb2002southwest]; [@leslie2001regional];[@dodds1990silicon].] Silicon Valley represents not only an example of a modern city, but also an alluring model for promoting economic and urban revitalization through technological industrial growth.

That promise has been consistently applied to cities in the American West. Electronics became a key component of the West's new economy as it shifted away from its historical extractive industries of mining, lumbering, and agriculture towards service, tourism, and knowledge work.^[[@taylor2004newwest]; [@abbott1995frontier]; [@abbott2008cities]; [@abbott1981urban, 15--56].] Throughout the West electronics manufacturers established headquarters, manufacturing facilities, and research offices, often courted by pro-growth advocates in city governments. These new industries pointed to the West as the leader of the nation's economic future predicated on a Cold War defense industry.^[[@fernlund1998coldwar].] Western cities were not replicating the steel age industries of the Midwest and East, with its smokestacks and large industrial structures that aided the earlier urban industrial age. Fueled by government policies promoting research and development, home ownership, and new jobs, cities embraced pro-growth policies that attempted to balance pastoralism with industrial expansion. The courting of white-collar, middle-class Americans led to explosive growth in new urban centers in the West. Yet the reliance on high-tech industrialization masked environmental hazards. Throughout the Rust Belt, the environmental effects of industrialization left very visible signs of potential threats to air and water quality. High tech industrialization promoted itself as a clean and modern alternative to industrialization, yet came with its own costs. Electronics manufacturing relied particularly upon liquid and gas chemicals, which were often stored on-site, shipped in on freight, lightly regulated by federal or state rules, and were potentially invisible hazards to human health. By removing the green shade, quality-of-life and social justice environmentalists targeted high tech industry and debated with boosters and industrialists about the industry's impact on communities.

High-tech industrial development was widely welcomed and considered a preferred alternative to the dirty industry of the Northeast and Midwest. The so-considered "clean" industries held the appearance of suburban areas with broad lawns, trees, low-rise buildings, and hidden parking lots. Thanks to strict building guidelines laid out by Stanford University as well as city regulations on new construction, new high technology industries appeared more like a college campus than an industrial manufacturer or research center. But the promise of clean industry proved elusive as smog, radiation, water contamination, intense energy and water usage, traffic congestion, and rising housing and utility costs became common features of living in the Valley.

This work is about grassroots politics produced by environmental degradation, suburbanization, and the interplay between local and national in the emergence of "environment" in American politics. California thinks of itself as a trend-setter, constantly reflecting and recreating the California Dream. Ideas about pastoralism and the promise of high tech industrialization represented an attempt to create this "good life," which played out on the landscape through competing conceptions of community. By bringing the environment, broadly construed, into the story of Silicon Valley and connecting it to the politics of growth, development, and community, I examine the ways people interacted and reacted to changes in their communities. 

Although this study is tightly focused on a specific region, it has greater bearing on understanding the inherent tension within land use and Americans' growing awareness of environmental issues during the postwar era. The study of Silicon Valley offers a chance to examine the emergence of a twenty-first century economy in the American West. American political economy in the postwar era was defined by technological innovation, market forces, waves of migration, government investment and regulation, and divided, fragmentary politics. Few of the industrialists, suburbanites, politicians, and activists in the pages ahead may have identified themselves as environmentalists, but Silicon Valley's political history demonstrates the ways "the environment" became an ever-present issue in American postwar politics.

The grassroots approach of this work reveals that environmentalists often cared less about political affiliations of Republican and Democrat but more often cared about their identities as homeowners and taxpayers. Environmental historians have often considered environmental history to be the domain of Democratic politics, and environmental issues often laid at the feet of the liberal political agenda. However, environmental politics between the 1950s and the 1970s often belied political affiliations. Suburban residents concerned with environmental issues were often unified in their vision of aesthetics, health, protection of children, pollution, and toxics. The history of Silicon Valley also belies the conventional narratives that suburbs primarily fostered a conservative political culture and the 1970s "Rise of the Right" accounts. Suburban liberalism continued to persist alongside the New Right in northern California. Rather than a rejection of liberalism evident in southern California's Orange County, Santa Clara County liberals fostered government intervention to serve their political interests.^[On the rise of the New Right and suburban politics, see: [@krusesugrue2006suburban]; [@mcgirr2001suburban]; [@kruse2005flight]; [@lassiter2006silent]; [@self2003babylon].] These suburban liberals, in some ways, anticipated the "New Democrats" under Bill Clinton in the early 1990s.^[Bill Clinton and other "New Democrats" also adopted Silicon Valley as a poster for the "New Economy." See Sara Miles, *How to Hack a Party Line: The Democrats and Silicon Valley* (University of California Press, 2002). On the role of suburban liberals shaping American politics, see [@geismer2015blame].] Yet the suburban liberals of Silicon Valley also underscores the limits of their vision. Their priorities for quality-of-life largely revolved around middle-class homeowners and high tech industry. The goals of environmental, feminist, labor, and racial justice activists went largely ignored.

By underscoring the local grassroots in environmentalism, the study reveals the variety of distinct and overlapping, evolving and organic local politics that intersected at regional, state, and national environmental discussions, especially around politics, culture, and policy. Environmentalism, then, is a local experience, and those local struggles became a primary driver for national change. Yet, much of the environmental activism in Silicon Valley was reactionary rather than pace-setting. The origins of an ecological consciousness and energy for political action in Santa Clara Valley suggests ideologies that predated much of the nation's eventual environmental sentiments in the 1970s.[^cf13] These politics emerged out of a combination of interests, animated by the rapid growth of the technological economy and questions raised for people living in the community.^[The importance of suburbs in fostering environmentalism has been argued by other historians, in particular [@sellers2012crucible] and [@rome2001bulldozer].]

Writing about environmental politics in the Bay Area also offers us ways to think about local politics. It might, as Richard Hofstadter once said, have "something to say that might help us."[^cf51] The story here is, ultimately, about the practice of politics in postwar America. Around kitchen tables, within ad hoc coalitions, in letter campaigns and newspaper editorials, people talked about the changing environment around them. Amenities and cultural ideals about the Bay Area---climate, atmosphere, suburban, middle-class---had attracted newcomers and delighted old--timers. But the rise of industry, the influx of new residents, the explosion of suburban development, and the devastation of orchards led both groups to question what sort of changes they were welcoming to the Valley. Some of these organizations were short-lived, such as the Citizens Committee on Regional Planning or United Palo Altans, while others existed much longer to continue influencing California politics, such as California Tomorrow and the Committee for Green Foothills. These environmental organizations emerged directly from environmental changes occurring in Silicon Valley.

Simultaneously, entrepreneurs, urban planners, university administrators, and city leaders offered an alternative vision to the landscape: one that was increasingly urban and industrial rather than rural and agricultural---but no less idealized. Often times support for growth was couched in the language of national defense: Cold War defense spending poured into Stanford University, for example, which eagerly sought out military contracts in research and development. Stanford administrators responded to citizens critiques of land development programs by dismissing their concerns as less important than national defense concerns. Unplanned urban growth and economic development characterized much of Santa Clara Valley in the latter half of the twentieth century. California voters became increasingly aware of the environmental considerations urban growth and industrial development had for the region, leading to political activism, new environmental regulation laws, and community referendums.[^cf52]

Historians of the American West have noted the importance of the "information revolution" to coastal California's development, but have done little to dive into its history. William Robbins noted almost two decades ago the "explosive expansion of the high--tech sector" that there existed "a new rural West---centered in the information revolution" were transforming urban prosperity and suburban poverty.^[@robbins1996newwest.] Earl Pomeroy's posthumously published *The Far West in the Twentieth Century* includes a brief history of the semiconductor industry and its outgrowth from military investments.^[@pomeroy2008west.] John Findlay was among the first western historians to place Silicon Valley into historical context, writing about how people created, and were affected by, urban culture. In particular, Findlay analyzes how urban environments were planned, built, managed, and used, and how inhabitants made sense of cities.  Findlay's analysis used Silicon Valley as one of his case studies, focusing on Stanford University and suburban landscapes to understand the ways that residents used the pastoralism of the university as a retreat from the chaos of urbanization. Margaret O'Mara extended the story in one of her case studies analyzing the success and failure of places that attempted to replicate Silicon Valley's success. O'Mara focused on how Stanford University played an important role in shaping land--use policies in Palo Alto and surrounding communities, and contextualizing the reasons behind Silicon Valley's success owing to pleasant climate, a white--collar workforce, the space to expand suburban areas, and proximity to a research university.[^cf10]

Historians have begun to explore the social and cultural consequences of Silicon Valley. Glenna Matthews addressed issues of gender, labor, and class in Silicon Valley. Matthews focuses her lens on immigrant women who worked in canneries and high-tech industries to "test [the] reality behind the [area's] glitzy image." Her focus on unionization of workers and their efforts towards social justice illustrates a dimension of the story not otherwise told. On issues of race in Northern California, Stephen Pitti has examined Mexican Americans and the long history of race relations and labor issues in the Bay Area. And Cecilia M. Tsu examined the agricultural past of Santa Clara Valley, studying Asian immigrants in Santa Clara Valley to examine the overlapping ideologies of race, gender, and labor between 1880 and 1940. These works have helped to uncover the story of Silicon Vally that have been ignored or gone unknown---race relations, social justice, labor, gender, and politics.^[@matthews2003dreams; @pitti2004devil; @tsu2013garden. See also Aaron Cavin's excellent study of race and citizenship in Silicon Valley among Mexican Americans and Asian Americans. [@cavin2012siliconvalley].] These works help to build my own by taking into account, in particular, the class and gendered dimensions of Silicon Valley's origins and postwar development. While Matthews primarily looks to blue-collar women inside the manufacturing facilities and canneries of Santa Clara Valley, I turn my gaze to white-collar professional women as leaders in promoting an environmental politic.^[The exception in Matthews' work is [@matthews2003dreams, chapter 6.] For additional work on gender, class, and race in Silicon Valley, see [@zlolniski2006mexican]; [@douglass1991meritocracy]; [@leigh1989dream]; [@tsu2006unskilled]; [@ruffin2014uninvited]; [@matthews1985labor].]

Other writers and observers have attempted to draw lessons from Silicon Valley's growth and development, but those works have targeted audiences interested in the entrepreneurs famous to the region. Tech journalist Robert Cringely, biographer Walter Isaacson, journalist Michael S. Malone and other popular writers have highlighted the importance of specific individuals in shaping the technology industry, but such works tend to celebrate individuals and companies rather than contextualize the Valley's history.[^cf11] Historians of business have offered more nuanced approaches to the Valley's history.^[See, especially, [@berlin2001noyce]. Berlin argues for the importance of Robert Noyce and the development of the integrated circuit in fostering a business culture in Silicon Valley. As Founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, Noyce represented an important public figure for the semiconductor industry that helped create a culture of innovation, creativity, and collaboration.] Furthermore, scholars have looked to the countercultural and libertarian origins of the Valley's political culture, whose ethos and energies likewise shaped the environmental politics described ahead.^[See, in particular, [@turner2006counterculture]; [@turner2005counterculture]; [@vettel2006biotech]; [@markoff2005dormouse].] My work intervenes in this discussion by placing suburban liberals into the history.

Few environmental histories have focused on local environmental histories, except in cases of single local campaigns. Most histories focus their geographic scale far above the local community, giving their attention to national legislation, federal agencies, or large environmental organizations. Those works that attempt to give attention to local action---namely Samuel Hays's classic *Beauty, Health, and Permanence*---address topics so briefly as to only give local activism but a few pages of discussion. The larger goal of such works has been to connect places and controversies to the wider national narrative. Other works have focused their lenses on single states or controversies, such as William Robbins's two volumes on Oregon and Andrew Hurley's *Environmental Inequalities*. By focusing on Silicon Valley, I add to the historiography on local environmentalism and look at the ways grassroots politics helped form state and national changes in policy, discourse, and ideology. If the Valley represents a promise for cities to jumpstart their economies, it also represents a pace-setting location for land use and regulation.^[Margaret O'Mara says that Silicon Valley was "home to some of the environmental movement's most important early battles and precedent-setting land-use planning measures". [@omara2005cities, 131]. The work that is closest to mine, and is owed a debt for his pathbreaking work, is [@walker2007countrycity], whose work illuminated the workings of a "green" political culture in the Bay Area. Walker's work does not focus primarily on Silicon Valley, however. His work ranges from the vineyards in Marin to the Bay conservation controversies. Walker's title is consciously drawn from [@williams1973countrycity].]

The lacunae of this dissertation stands at the intersection urban development, postwar suburbanization, recreation and leisure, business history, and American environmentalism, arguing that the politics of growth intersected with a powerful nostalgia about the countryside of Santa Clara Valley. Environmental critics argued that industrialization and real estate development served to ruin the environment, introducing sprawling places that wrought ecological havoc and erased a sense of community identity. These debates highlight the malleability of landscapes. More broadly, these attempts to define the landscape shape the political, cultural, and social norms that tend to shape space and geography. As other historians of space and place have noted, the spatial structures used to order the world produce a metageography that relies on myths and half-truths in order to create a narrative of place.^[[@schulten2012mapping, 3]; [@wigen1997metageography]; [@wigen2010malleable].]

That malleability forms my core analytical framework. In order to recover conflicts among communities, I have imposed some order onto the analysis. In particular, the concept of landscape has held particular promise in helping unravel how and why communities vied over land use. The geographer D. W. Meinig refers to landscapes as "a naïve acceptance of the intricate intermingling of physical, biological, and cultural features which any glance around us displays."^[[@meinig1979landscapes, 2].] Cordoned off sites for military installations, polluted grounds, and wildlife refuges hold just as much meaning as neighborhoods and city districts defined for particular uses or perceived of in particular ways. The Santa Clara Valley---indeed, much of the American West---contain what Richard White has called "hybrid landscapes" where cultural ideologies clash over conflicting uses of natural resources. The hybrid landscape is neither purely wild nor purely built, but instead a construction of natural and cultural systems that shape and create place.[^cf21] People define places by laying down ideas on the landscape. In cities, urban planners lay down grids of roads, zones, and regulations that divide cities along labor, leisure, and consumption, thus imbuing certain places with particular meaning.^[[@lefebvre1992space, 68--168]; Cameron Blevins, "Space, Nation, and Triumph of Region: A View of the World from Houston," *Journal of American History* (June 2014);[@tuan1977spaceplace]; [@decerteau1984everyday]; John A. Agnew and James S. Duncan, eds., *The Power of Place: Bringing Together Geographical and Sociological Imaginations* (Unwin Hyman, 1989).] Landscapes were constructed as physical and conceptual boundaries were drawn around competing landscapes in Silicon Valley by interests and communities vying to define their metropolitan future.[^cf22] 

These competing landscapes formed the cultural and political underpinnings of Silicon Valley's environmental politic. In the Santa Clara Valley, the creation of new landscapes resulting from perceptions of the region as farmland, electronics manufacturer, suburban paradise, and natural paradise shaped the Valley's environment. The underlying and conflicting connections among these landscapes shaped environmental, cultural, and political identities.[^cf15] Landscapes, in Meinig's words, are "a great exhibit of consequences," and are "symbolic, as expressions of cultural values, social behavior, and individual actions worked upon particular localities over a span of time."^["Introduction," in [@meinig1979landscapes].] By viewing Silicon Valley this way, I argue for the significance of nature to shaping space and perceptions in crafting a suburban high-tech urbanism. Rather than echo Lewis Mumford's claim that "as the pavement spreads, nature is pushed away," I argue the creation of landscapes was both natural and social.^[Lewis Mumford, *The Culture of Cities* (1938; reprint, San Diego: Harcourt, Brace, 1970), 253. See also [@williams1973countrycity], [@smith1984nature, 55--58];[@monkonnen1988urban, 3]; [@cronon1989metropolis, 7].] Nature and cities are not distinct entities, and any separation among them is nearly futile.^[I am influenced here also by Ari Kelman's terrific study of New Orleans and the Mississippi River. Kelman sees nature and the city as inseparable, arguing that "New Orlean's waterfront represents a mingling of built and natural environments, and that the production of space in New Orleans has been both a natural and social process." See [@kelman2006landscape, 1--17].]

Machines in the Valley consists of community studies focusing primarily around San José and Palo Alto, arranged in five chronologically thematic chapters. The first two chapters explore the structural and political forces that created the political culture of suburban environmentalists in Silicon Valley. The idealized pastoralism of the Santa Clara Valley was a significant draw for nineteenth century boosters and town builders, a theme that continued well into the postwar era. That vision sought to build cities in tune with the natural world, first through farming and later through leisure and aesthetics. These foundations paved the way for a variety of grassroots activism. The remaining chapters examine how suburbanites confronted, challenged, and conformed to new political and environmental realities, including the collapse of the farm economy, rampant urban sprawl and industrialization that threatened the amenities that drew residents to the Valley, and the often-hidden health risks of airborne and waterborne pollutants that obliterated suburbanites' sense as privileged communities.

Silicon Valley has become a cultural center in the United States; the wealth, political influence, environmental precedence, and place in the American imagination has led the Valley to take on an almost mystical quality in American life. Cities and universities across the country and across the world try and mimic the success of Silicon Valley and Stanford University. The Valley is synonymous with the technology industry, an industry that has taken on ever increasing importance to the nation's economy. Furthermore, the economic importance of regions like Silicon Valley meant that places where suburban liberalism persisted also led to shifts in political discourse at the state and national level in both parties as the priorities of suburbanites and their employers took hold. These priorities not only manifested themselves in economic policies like free trade, tax cuts, and continued investment into high-tech industry, but also through environmental policies and regulations that filtered up from local issues.

This history is also about the history that Silicon Valley has inherited. The Valley often thinks of itself as outside of history---always looking to the future, at the forefront of change and progress. But the organization and imagination of Silicon Valley---its landscape, its communities, its relationships---are inseparable from its past. People here live with its history daily. We must recognize how desires for beauty, nature, and pleasure shape our spatial history, landscape, and nostalgia embodied in cities. Cities, the novelist Italo Calvino reminds us in *Invisible Cities*, do "not tell [their] past" but are "like lines on a hand, written in the corners of the streets, the gratings of the windows, the banisters of the steps, the antennae of the lightning rods, the poles of the flags, every segment marked in turn with scratches, indentations, scrolls."^[Italo Calvino, *Invisible Cities*, trans. (New York: Harcourt Brace and Company, 1974), 11.] Cities and the nature that surrounds them---that is embedded in them---are reflections of past and present desires. To build better cities, we must reflect the ways our landscapes match our aspirations.

### A Note on Sources

This is not a history of prominent leaders often attributed to the creation of Silicon Valley---the veritable household names of David Packard, William Hewlett, Robert Noyce, and Steve Jobs. But a note on the people that do appear here merits some attention. Although the pages ahead dive little into business leaders often credited with the origins of the Valley, the people that appear are largely white, male, affluent elites. Race certainly plays a role in environmental conversations in Silicon Valley, particularly among the largest community of color, Latinos. Activism around environmental issues in Santa Clara County, however, are not a major driving force of Latino politics in the postwar era. More political energy is spent on issues related to housing, employment, citizenship, and discrimination---and although "environment" appears within some of these issues, my archival sources did not often reflect that. However, there does exist ample evidence for future work on Silicon Valley and the intermixing of race and environment. There is little work, for example, on the role of Latino laborers working inside high tech manufacturing facilities who were exposed to harsh chemicals during the manufacturing process.^[Some early work includes [@matthews2003dreams]; [@smith2006challenging]; [@pitti2004devil];[@zlolniski2006mexican].] 

Many of the sources used in this study were drawn from, primarily, people working within the confines of traditional political power. Local government publications, in particular, played a big role in framing the ways government leaders sought to shape and define high tech suburbanization in Silicon Valley. Much of the source material is drawn from, in particular, a documentary record surrounding land use and environmental regulations and legislation. The evidence from these sources rarely confronted issues surrounding race, at least as it applied to the environment.^[One of the archives I went through, for example, included the Don Edwards Papers at San José State University. Edwards' papers includes large amounts of material related to African American and Latino housing issues in particular. See, in particular, Box 72 and Box 84 in the Don Edwards Congressional Papers, San José State University.] 

Based on my evidence, class and gender play much larger roles in the story ahead. The affluent, white-collar suburbanites drove much of the responses to environmental laws and regulations. Planning and regulation largely benefited these suburban white neighborhoods over ethnic enclaves. As the pages ahead show, pollution was often offloaded to areas of cities away from high property values, middle-class neighborhoods, and high tech industrial districts. Postwar suburbanization largely benefited the white middle class, giving them a chance to enjoy environmental amenities of suburban life while environmental costs were shuffled onto non-white communities on the suburban fringe. This environmental racism---the unequal distribution of environmental hazards along lines of race---largely occurred within class privilege. In Silicon Valley, the environmental dangers of flooding, subsidence, and sewage processing largely exempted middle-class whites.^[[@pulido2000racism]; [@bullard1990dixie]; [@pellowpark2002dreams]; [@hurley1995inequalities]; [@pulido1996justice]; Marc Cooper, "Class War @ Silicon Valley: Disposable Workers in the New Economy," *The Nation*, May 27, 1996.]

Gender plays the bigger role in Silicon Valley's urban environmental history than class or race. To a great degree, many of the earliest activists for the environment were women. Whether starting out as affordable housing activists in San Francisco or concerned about high tech pollution in their neighborhoods threatening family health, women led the way in galvanizing political activity around environmental issues.^[[@matthews2003dreams]; [@douglass1991meritocracy].] In the 1970s, the widespread ascent of women into political office, especially in San José and Santa Clara County government, led to the moniker "Feminist Capital of the World." Lawyers, housewives, politicians, scientists, engineers, and mothers such as Pam Tau Lee, Janet Gray Hayes, Mary Bowerman, Dorothy Erskine, and Lorraine Ross were central grassroots activists. In public and private spheres---local government, neighborhoods, the home---women developed a "green" political culture primarily revolving around health. Janet Gray Hayes in particular plays a key role in the story ahead as she and her suburban liberal allies built coalitions with environmentalists, labor groups, and minorities to promote "smart growth" in San José. These female activists shifted the grounds on which debates about sustainability, livability, open space, leisure, and health took place, standing against pro-growth advocates in city and regional government.

Stegner's novel *All the Little Live Things*, was written based on the Santa Clara Valley. The novel's character, Joe Allston, lamented the bulldozers, subdivisions, and scars that cut into the Earth. Remarking on the work of the fiction's land developer, Allston said that the hills were "mutilated and ruined" and "only a land butcher could have proposed and carried it out. . . . There would be no restoring what he had ruined. It reminded me too painfully; it made me sick to look." Stegner, *The Little Live Things*, (New York: Viking, 1967), 14--15.

[^cf20]: I am borrowing the idea of overlapping landscapes from Leisl
Carr-Childers. She uses four overlapping landscapes---wild horse,
military-nuclear, ranch, and outdoor recreation---to understand land--use
conflicts and debates over the equitable use of western public lands in the
Great Basin. See Carr-Childers, "The Size of the Risk: An Environmental
History of the Nuclear Great Basin," Ph.D. Dissertation, University of
Nevada--Las Vegas, 2011.

[^cf21]: [@white2004hybrid, 562--664]. In Richard White's survey of trends in environmental history, he argues historians reject any hard division between culture and natural. Instead, they examine how cultural forces shape landscapes. Kenneth Olwig has argued that landscape is a physical and cultural manifestation, where "environment, economics, law, and culture are all important," and symbolic, "to be perceived, read, and interpreted on the ground, in written texts, and through artistic images." Kenneth R. Olwig, "Recovering the Substantive Nature of Landscape," *Annals of the Association of American Geographers* (December 1996): 645. See also Donald Meinig, "The Interpretation of Ordinary Landscapes," in *The Beholding Eye: Ten Versions of the Same Scene*, ed. Donald Meinig, pp. 43--45; Keith H. Basso, *Wisdom Sits in Places*, p. 110. William Cronon has argued the same phenomenon happens when Americans construct and then preserve wilderness to suit ideas of sublime nature while disregarding less--striking landscapes. See William Cronon, "The Trouble with Wilderness; or, Getting Back to the Wrong Nature," in *Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature*, ed. Cronon, (New York: Norton, 1996), 69--90.
