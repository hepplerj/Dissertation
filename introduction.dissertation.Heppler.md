Wallace Stegner lamented the changes occurring to the Santa Clara Valley
in 1965. From his home in the foothills of the Santa Cruz Mountains that
creep along the western edge of the valley, the Stanford creative
writing professor lamented the urban sprawl that had overtaken the
former farmland in the flatlands. "The orchards that used to be a spring
garden of bloom down the long trough of the Santa Clara Valley," he
wrote, "have gone under so fast that a person absent for five years
could return and think himself in another country. . . . The
once--lovely coast hills reaching down the Peninsula below San Francisco
have been crusted with houses in half a lifetime, the hilltops
flattened, whole hills carried off to fill the bay, the creeks turned
into concrete storm drains."[^cf3] In Stegner's lifetime, the Valley had
transformed from prime agricultural land to a place known for urban
sprawl, traffic jams, and industrial facilities. Stegner's sensibilities
were so insulted by the environmental damage that he wished to be buried
not in California---the place that had so deeply shaped his writing and
identity---but in his summer home of Vermont.[^cf4]

Stegner was a newcomer to this land. Born in 1909 in north-central Iowa,
Stegner came to California to teach in the creative writing program at
Stanford University. In Stegner's imagination the Santa Clara Valley had
fallen from pristine grace. He wrote of "a park-like oak forest reaching
southward from a clean bay" when the native Ohlone's occupied the
region. "The climate was mild and benevolent, the bay full of shellfish.
The creeksides tangles grew wild berries and the oaks provided the
wherewithal for unlimited acorn flour." Stegner not only celebrated this
imagined pre-European landscape, but the post-European one as well. As
fields of wheat and fruit groves planted by Spanish missionaries began
to transform the Bay Area into an agricultural landscape, Stegner
celebrated these as "a glory"---that pears, prunes, apricots, cherry
blossoms, and apples were an improvement upon nature. "This brief Eden,"
as Stegner referred to the Valley, fell to the original sin of
industrialization.^[William S. Cooper, "Vegetational Development upon
Alluvial Fans in the Vicinity of Palo Alto, CA," *Ecology* 7 (January
1927): 11.]

Frederick E. Terman interpreted the landscape differently. The Stanford
University provost and dean of engineering---often referred to as the "Father
of Silicon Valley"---saw suburbanization and expansion of industry in the
Santa Clara Valley not as signs of degradation, but rather signposts towards a
new prosperous future for Stanford, for Santa Clara County, for California,
and for the nation. The newly--founded Stanford Industrial Park and the lands
around the university, rather than seen as encroaching sprawl, were, in the
words of one booster, a "pleasant place" of "broad lawns, employee patios,
trees, flowers and shrubs, walls of glass, recreational clubs" that stood in
contrast to the "smoke--stacks, noise, coal cars, soot and other things" found
in the industrial East and Midwest.[^cf5] The landscape appeared campus--like
and suburban, amenities that reflected the values of Stanford and surrounding
suburban communities. Although complaints of traffic and air pollution had
become common by the mid--1960s, Terman dismissed these complaints. The
Industrial Park had done much for the Bay Area's economy, and Terman felt
congestion and air pollution were "really a pretty small price to pay."[^cf6]

Like Stegner, Terman had come to California from elsewhere. Born in 1900
in English, Indiana, Terman's family moved to Stanford in 1910 when
his father, the psychologist Lewis Terman, accepted a position in
educational psychology. Terman completed his doctorate at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology working under Vannevar Bush before returning to
Stanford in 1924 to start the university's initial forays into
electronics research.

Not acknowledged by either Stegner or Terman was the environmental
influence that these industrial activities had on the Santa Clara
Valley. The celebrated orchards introduced exotic species in California, the
result of European and American colonization. Furthermore, the
cultivation of these species required an infrastructure to support
canneries, cannery effluence, and controlling the land with pesticides
and herbicides. Stegner's own contradiction of lament for Spaniard
colonization and celebration of orchards poses significant questions:
How should the land be treated? What counts as improvement or
denigration upon the landscape? Terman's own views of the Valley reflect
a similar set of questions: Should the built environment be assessed differently
from the natural environment? Was the arrival of Silicon Valley an
improvement upon nature? Implicit in both views revolves a core
question: Who defines the valley landscape?

How is it that people look at the cities and see very different places? These
competing visions of the Santa Clara Valley landscape reflected widely-held
and conflicting ideas about the future of the Valley. In the face of
residential growth and industrial development, the Santa Clara Valley's
landscape changed remarkably. The arrival of machines in the Valley---
bulldozers and computers---transformed the landscape, and in the process
sparked local environmental activism. Valley residents, business leaders, city
officials, and university administrators vied over the definition of Santa
Clara Valley's future, and in the process shaped debates about environmental
change. Unrestricted urban growth and economic development characterized much
of Santa Clara Valley in the latter half of the twentieth century, but little
told is the story of the environmental consequences of Silicon Valley and
those who attempted to shape the region's environmental future.[^cf7]
California voters became increasingly aware of the environmental impact urban
and industrial development was having, leading by the 1970s to residents
attempting to curtail industrialization, limit urban growth, and reject
large--scale water projects. Environmental organizations, formal and ad hoc,
began criticizing high technology firms and city leaders for their ignorance
of ecological negligence. Such organizing formed the burgeoning Bay Area
environmental movement.

<!--
WORKING THROUGH A NEW INTRO

The competing vision of the Peninsula as a geography of industry versus
the geography of beauty suggests the malleability of landscapes. More
broadly, these attempts to define landscape shape the political,
cultural, and social norms that tend to shape space and geography. As
numerous historians have noted---Susen Schulten, Martin Lewis and KÃ¤ren
Wigen, Kenneth Jackson, and others---the spatial structures used to
order the world produce a metageography that relies on myths and
half-truths in order to create a narrative of place. How these ideas
were created, negotiated, and challenged forms the subject of this
study.^[@schulten2001imagination, 3.]

Another aim of this text is to think bigger about Silicon Valley, about California, and its national context. Silicon Valley is often given an exceptionalist thesis----a place with a unique set of circumstances that made it an anomaly in postindustrial America, a place that other places tried to replicate. Silicon Valley became a gold standard, cited by journalists, scholars, critics, and pundits throughout the country as an example of a friendly business climate, residential paradise, and economic powerhouse. Places as varied as Atlanta, Philadelphia, Cleveland, Omaha, Bangalore, India, Mission Hills in the Guandong Province of China, and Shenzhen, China, have all looked to Silicon Valley as a vision for their futures----going so far as to model their architectural designs after the Spanish villa and ranch aesthetic of Santa Clara County.^[See, for example, Margaret O'Mara, "Silicon Valleys," *Boom: A Journal of California* 1 (Summer 2011) <http://www.boomcalifornia.com/2011/06/silicon-valleys/>.] But in viewing Silicon Valley as exceptional is to miss similar economic, cultural, and environmental transformations happening throughout the Sunbelt and global sites of postindustrial capital. Phoenix, Arizona, for example, underwent its own high-technology transformations in the postwar era, and like Silicon Valley, had to deal with the fallout of manufacturing and pollution. For all the claims of today's "green" industries and Google's gloating of solar panels on its building roofs, there's a history that explains why tech tries to present itself as green.
-->

Electronics became a key component of the West's service industry, but 
simultaneously became a pressing issue for the environment where such 
activity centralized itself. Throughout the West electronics 
manufacturers established headquarters, manufacturing facilities, and 
research offices, often courted by pro-growth advocates in city 
governments. With the rise of middle-class, quality-of-life 
environmentalism, however, the electronics industry became a target for 
its impact on wildlife, water quality, air pollution, and open space, 
especially in the western boomtowns where electronics formed the 
dominant economic activity. In turn, these concerns shaped politics in 
western states like California as pro-growth boosters debated with 
Californians worried about the rapid pace of growth and its impact on 
quality of life.


This work begins with a simple question: does nature matter to Silicon Valley?
Which points to an even bigger question: how does nature matter to American
cities? Beginning to answer that question involves extending historian Kenneth
Jackson's claim that "the space around us---the physical organization of
neighborhoods, roads, yards, houses, and apartments---sets up living patterns
that condition our behavior."[^cf8] In Silicon Valley, the attitudes, ideas,
and values people imparted on to nature---biological and idealized---helps us
understand how ideas of nature and efforts to preserve or transform landscapes
played out in postindustrial American society. By exploring the ways people
created space, the politics they engaged in to protect that space, and
examining the physical changes to the landscape that resulted, this
dissertation argues for the importance of understanding how space creates
politics. The story of Silicon Valley told here is over who's place the Valley
would become: A postindustrial powerhouse? Fertile and beautiful agricultural
producer? Countryside paradise? Metropolitan trend-setter?

What gives rise to the environmental movement in the Santa Clara Valley are
the spatial and cultural politics stemming from high--tech industrialization.
The metropolitan region of the Santa Clara Valley allows for an important
inquiry into postwar environmentalism. The Bay Area in many respects
anticipated the environmental politics that played out on the national stage.
Ten years before federal laws regulated clean air, water contamination, and
the preservation of open space, environmental political actors in the Bay Area
organized to preserve their quality of life, the preservation of landscapes,
and formed critiques of environmental degradation.

This work is about grassroots politics produced by environmental catastrophes,
suburbanization, the interplay between local and national in the emergence of
an unified environmental movement in American politics. The conceptualization
of different landscapes resulted from different visions and perceptions of the
region. Since the full history of the region's landscapes cannot be told, this
work will chronicle the landscapes through a narrative of the area. This is
not a history of prominent people often attributed to the creation of Silicon
Valley---the veritable household names of David Packard, William Hewlett,
Robert Noyce, and Steve Jobs. Instead, this is a story of the land, air, and
water in one of the United States' major population centers and the people
that live there. The story is about the tension between *intent* and *actual* use
of land use, and how different ideas for the use of land informed the
shape of the land itself.

Historians of the American West have offhandedly noted the importance of the
"information revolution" to the coastal California's development, but have
done little to dive into the history. William Robbins noted almost two decades
ago the "explosive expansion of the high--tech sector" that there existed "a
new rural West---centered in the information revolution" were transforming
urban prosperity and suburban poverty.^[@robbins1996newwest.] Earl Pomeroy's
posthumously published *The Far West in the Twentieth Century* includes a
brief history of the semiconductor industry and its outgrowth from military
investments.^[@pomeroy2008west.] John Findlay was among the first western
historians to place Silicon Valley into historical context, writing about how
people created, and were affected by, urban culture. In particular, Findlay
analyzes how urban environments were planned, built, managed, and used, and
how inhabitants made sense of cities.  Findlay's analysis used Silicon Valley
as one of his case studies, focusing on Stanford University and suburban
landscapes to understand the ways that residents used the pastoralism of the
university as a retreat from the chaos of urbanization. Margaret O'Mara
extended the story in one of her case studies analyzing the success and
failure of places that attempted to replicate Silicon Valley's success. O'Mara
focused on how Stanford University played an important role in shaping
land--use policies in Palo Alto and surrounding communities, and
contextualizing the reasons behind Silicon Valley's success owing to pleasant
climate, a white--collar workforce, the space to expand suburban areas, and
proximity to a research university. Geographer AnnaLee Saxenian compared the
differences between the Bay Area's Silicon Valley and Boston's Route
128.[^cf10]

Other writers and observers have attempted to draw lessons from Silicon
Valley's growth and development, but those works have targeted audiences
interested in the entrepreneurs famous to the region. Tech journalist Robert
Cringely, biographer Walter Isaacson, journalist Michael S. Malone and other
popular writers have highlighted the importance of specific individuals in
shaping the technology industry, but such works tend to celebrate
individuals and companies rather than contextualize the Valley's history.[^cf11]
Historians of business have offered more nuanced approaches to the Valley's
history.^[See, especially, @berlin2001noyce.]

Historians have begun to explore the social and cultural consequences of
Silicon Valley. Glenna Matthews addressed issues of gender, labor, and class
in Silicon Valley. Matthews focuses her lens on immigrant women who worked in
canneries and high-tech industries to "test [the] reality behind the [area's]
glitzy image." Her focus on unionization of workers and their efforts towards
social justice illustrates a dimension of the story not otherwise told. On
issues of race in Northern California, Stephen Pitti has examined Mexican
Americans and the long history of race relations and labor issues in the Bay
Area. And Cecilia M. Tsu examined the agricultural past of Santa Clara Valley,
studying Asian immigrants in Santa Clara Valley to examine the overlapping
ideologies of race, gender, and labor between 1880 and 1940. These works have
helped to uncover the story of Silicon Vally that have been ignored or gone
unknown---race relations, social justice, labor, gender, and
politics.^[@matthews2003dreams; @pitti2004devil; @tsu2013garden.]

Few environmental histories have focused on local environmental histories,
except in in case of single local campaigns. Most histories focus their
geographic scale far above the local community, giving their attention to
national legislation, federal agencies, or large environmental organizations.
Those works that attempt to give attention to local action---namely Samuel
Hays's classic *Beauty, Health, and Permanence*---address topics so fast as to
only give local activism but a few pages of discussion. The larger goal of
such works has been to connect places and controversies to the wider national
narrative. Other works have focused their lenses on single states or
controversies, such as William Robbins's two volumes on Oregon, Andrew
Hurley's *Environmental Inequalities*, and  Richard Walker's *Country and the
City* which focused on San Francisco Bay from the nineteenth century to the
present.

Historians of metropolitan America have painted a synthesis of city 
experiences that {DETAIL}.

This work stands at the intersections of metropolitan history, political 
history, environmental history, and political economy. It extends a 
question raised by Andrew Needham about the role of *regions* in the 
shaping of metropolitan space, not just the localities. Although any one 
of the cities of the Bay Area---which numbers {DETAIL} municipal 
corporations by the 1990s---would work well for analyzing the trends in 
environmental politics in Silicon Valley, by thinking about these 
changes at a regional level shows how places across space shaped one 
another and worked collaboratively and at odds in shaping metropolitan 
space.

In the 1960s, political activists called on people to "think globally, act
locally." That is the story here. The Bay Area---comprised of the area between
San Francisco to the north and San Jose to the south---has become an economic
and cultural powerhouse of the twenty--first century. Known today as "Silicon
Valley," this region contains a mix of metropolitan area, greenbelts, and open
space. Of the nine counties in the region, 3.75 million of 4.5 million acres
are greenbelt and open water, and less than 750,000 acres lie beneath the
built environment. More than one million acres are protected open areas or
greenbelts, including more than 200 public parks and reserves. Combined, there
is more green space in the San Francisco Bay Area than the entirety of
Yosemite National Park.[^cf12]

But green space only tells part of the story. While vast areas of open space
are available to Bay Area residents, there is more to the story of Silicon
Valley's relationship to nature. As early as the 1940s, conservationists were
finding ways to limit the industrialization of the Santa Clara Valley---first,
resisting the establishment of large canneries, corporate farms, and
manufacturing facilities, and later the high tech manufacturers moving into
the Valley. Histories of environmental politics often trace the origins of the
environmental movement to the 1960s, lumping the movements into the
generalities of the counterculture, civil rights, and justice movements. But
in the Bay Area, these ideas took hold nearly a decade sooner. The origins of
an ecological consciousness and energy for political action in Santa Clara
Valley suggests energies and ideologies that predated much of the nation's
eventual environmental sentiments.[^cf13]

## Events Take Place

Space forms the central component of this study. Geographer John Wright has
argued that "places are best seen as shifting stages where the exercise of
power and resistance to it vie for dominance."[^cf14] Physical and conceptual
boundaries were drawn around competing landscapes in the Bay Area. These
boundaries encapsulated three landscapes: agriculture, high technology, and
urban growth and development. These intermixed landscapes placed unique but
concurrent pressures on natural resources in the Bay Area, introducing
ramifications not only at the local and state level but also the national
level. Although this study is tightly focused on a specific region, it has
greater bearing on understanding the inherent tension between local and
national politics and Americans' growing awareness of environmental issues. In
the Santa Clara Valley, the development of new landscapes, resulting from
various perceptions of the region as farmland, electronics manufacturer,
residential oasis, and natural beauty shaped the Valley's environment. Through
examining these three hybrid landscapes that express the different ways in
which people constructed different water use programs to fit human cultural
and economic needs, I argue the underlying and conflicting interconnectedness
of these landscapes shaped environmental, cultural, and political identities
and in the process exacted significant costs from the Bay Area's human and
natural ecology. The story told here stands at the intersections of
postindustrial society, environmental history, the spatial politics of
suburbanization and economic development, and the rise of environmental
politics.[^cf15]

Space shaped residents' social and political identities, but space was also
defined by residents and industrialists. The philosopher Henri Lefebvre noted
in the 1970s that societies produce space, challenging that space serves as a
vessel receiving meaning rather than a backdrop to historical events. We can
see how the imposition of space shapes cities as planners place down grids of
roads, zones, and regulations that divide cities along labor, leisure, and
consumption. The daily movement of people and capital---tourists, cyclists,
taxi drivers, commuters, freight---imbue neighborhoods and localities with
different meanings and give them specific senses of place.[^cf16]

The political and cultural story intertwines with a spatial story. The Santa
Clara Valley was the site of one of the nation's greatest modernizations of
urban space. More than 138,000 acres of farmland were paved over, built upon,
unearthed, or buried between 1940 and 1960, all in an effort to support an
expanding high tech industry and its rapidly growing workforce.[^cf17] The
residents of the Santa Clara Valley sought to improve the places in which they
lived and worked, and many of these projects were spatial: environmental
issues and environmental justice emerged from industrial pollution, storm
runoff, subsidence, suburban expansion, and traffic congestion within
different parts of the metropolis. Even ostensibly non-spatial politics were
embedded in local geography, and these spatial politics were intertwined with
environmental politics.

Space forms a critical understanding the history of Santa Clara Valley. Within
space, as Robert Self writes in his analysis of Oakland, people "competed to
put those resources to use to create particular and concrete places."[^cf18]
Space is not just an abstract consideration of a place, but rather is
historically concrete---the growth of suburban factories, residential and
commercial growth, and environmental politics all operated in place.
Historical actors and their spaces they operate in are inseparable. The
experiences of people, communities, and institutions take place in the very
fabric of life and space. The calls for urban reform, environmental concerns,
and critiques against industry did not take place abstractly; political actors
made specific demands about specific places. Space does not tell the entire
story, but overlooking space is to miss a significant part.[^cf19]

I argue to understand the Valley's relationship to environmental activism we
can examine three contested landscapes in the Bay Area: natural, suburban, and
industrial.[^cf20] Contests over the environment took place within these
competing and constructed landscapes in California. The Bay Area---indeed,
much of the American West---contains what Richard White has called "hybrid
landscapes" where cultural ideologies clash over conflicting uses of natural
resources. The hybrid landscape is not purely wild or built but instead a
construction of natural and cultural systems that shape and create
place.[^cf21] Places are defined by people constructing places for diverse
purposes. Landscapes are also a way of seeing the land, a perspective that
emphasizes aspects of geography that appeal to beauty, economy, or culture.
Landscapes are both physically and mentally constructed according to our
preferences and experiences. In turn, these expectations shape and reshape the
environment.[^cf22]

The grassroots approach of this work reveals that environmentalists often
cared less about political affiliations of Republican and Democrat but more
often cared about their identities as homeowners and taxpayers. Environmental
historians have often considered environmental history to be the domain of
Democratic politics, and environmental issues often laid at the feet of the
liberal political agenda. However, environmental politics between the 1950s
and the 1970s often belied political affiliations. Suburban residents
concerned with environmental issues were often unified in their vision of
aesthetics, health, protection of children, pollution, and toxics.

<!--
The emergence of environmental politics in the Bay Area emerged from the
confluence of three overlapping landscapes that came into conflict in the
postwar era. These three hybrid landscapes, three ways that cultural practices
framed and determined human interaction with the area's geography. Together,
these landscapes form the cultural underpinnings of environmental political
activity in the Bay Area. First, the Natural Landscape {EXPAND}. Second, the
Industrial Landscape {EXPAND}. Finally, the Urban Landscape {EXPAND}. Taken
together, these landscapes form a complex environmental map of their regional
construction, implementation in the American West, and efficacy in California.

The Santa Clara Valley lies between two branches of the Coast Range mountains.
The Santa Cruz mountains to the west are covered in coastal redwoods that give
the mountains a green vail all year long. The Diablo Range to the east remains
dry and khaki brown for most of the year except during the short rainy season.
The Mediterranean climate of the Bay Area means the region receives little
rainfall outside the period between November and April. On average, the
semiarid Valley receives about fourteen inches of rain annually.[^cf26] The
Coastal Range shields the Santa Clara Valley from frosts and major storms, and
temperatures rarely drop below freezing or become excessively warm, although
conditions of droughts and excessive rainfall do occurr.[^cf27] The Santa
Clara Valley's climate, John Muir remarked when passing through in the spring
of 1872, was "the best we ever enjoyed."[^cf28]

Hydrologically, the area is crossed by several streams and rivers that snake
their way down the mountains. Historically, the majority of these water
sources never created deep channels, often forming shallow pathways that were
prone to flooding. Most mountain runoff quickly dissipated into well--drained
alluvial soil and replenished groundwater aquifers. Freshwater marshes,
seasonally--flooded meadows, forested wetlands, and riparian habitats were
common historical features on the valley landscape.[^cf29] In addition to
overland water sources, the valley is supplied by a regional aquifer that
consisted of multiple Pleistocene aquifers grouped into upper and lower
systems. These groundwater systems were replenished primarily through
precipitation, stream channels, and, today, by artificial recharge ponds. The
presence of rock faults also serve as potential sources and barriers of
hydrological flows.[^cf30] The Valley has few rivers coursing through it.
Twenty--six major creeks flow through the valley, and the major rivers flowing
through the Valley include the Arroyo Hondo, Guadalupe River, and Pajaro
River, which originate in the Santa Cruz or Diablo Range mountains and empty
into the Calaveras Reservoir, the San Francisco Bay, and the Pacific Ocean
respectively. A majority of the thirty--seven lakes that exist in Santa Clara
County are artificial or serve as reservoirs. Two major dam projects, the
Coyote Dam built in 1936 and the Anderson Dam built in 1950, began regulating
watershed discharge. Recent changes in vegetation and habitats came about due
to changes in stream hydrology that included flood control efforts and summer
water releases from groundwater recharge associated with the Coyote and
Anderson dams.[^cf31]

112.](figures/landcover.png)

The valley hosted a variety of lifeforms. Along the valley floor, oak scrub,
cacti, and a variety of oak, willow, sycamore, and alder trees provided cover
for wildlife and shelters for native grasses. At higher elevations, a variety
of conifers including coastal redwoods (*Sequoia sempervirens*), ponderosa pine
(*pinus ponderosa*), sugar pine (*pinus lambertiana*) mingled with white fir
(*Abies concolor*) and black oak (*Quercus kelloggii*) that carpeted the mountains
in green. The plants of the Valley adapted to the Mediterranean climate:
perennial bunchgrasses die back every winter, leaving only roots to help
preserve water; oak trees have extensive root systems to tap into groundwater
supplies.[^cf32] The oak woodlands and chaparral ecoregions provided habitats
for acton woodpeckers, nuthatch, oak titmouse, and Pacific pallid bats. Major
waterways supported a diverse range of native fish species, including Pacific
lamprey (*Lampetra tridentata*), steelhead trout, chinook salmon, Sacramento
blackfish, and tule perch, among many others. Golden beavers and raccoons
shared the landscape with rabbits, squirrels, and other small species, as well
as a variety of snakes, lizards, spiders, and insects. Mountain lions, wolves,
and grizzly bears once hunted and lived in the valley, mingling with ungulates
such as elk and mule deer. Woodpeckers, wrentits, scrub jays, Chestnut-backed
Chickadees, and hundreds of additional bird species thrived in the Valley's
skies.

The agricultural landscape John Muir observed at the turn of the century was
just beginning to shift under the influence of American settlement.[^cf33] The exceptional
growing climate, fertile soil, and plentiful water from artesian wells allowed
farmers to transform the landscape into the fruit capital it would be known as
worldwide.[^cf34] The cultivation and processing of apricots, prunes, pears,
and cherries became staples on the horticulture landscape.[^cf35] Fruit trees
produced a canopy of pink and white blossoms along with orange California
poppies and other native wildflowers that bloomed on the hillsides. The
blooming seasons were popular early in the twentieth century as visitors
flocked to the area to behold the orchards in full bloom, along with
farmhouses, berry patches, vegetable gardens, and pastures.[^cf36] Little
wonder why the Santa Clara Valley boosters advertised the area as "nearest
Paradise" and "the best spot in the whole earth," a place where "the Eden of
vine and tree" was a "God-favored spot" and "God's favorite valley."[^cf37]

several times per year depending on which trees were in bloom. Source:

Library.](figures/blossomtours.png)

Cattle ranching, wheat and grain production, and quicksilver mining flourished
in the Valley in the nineteenth century prior to the Valley becoming "one vast
orchard."[^cf38] By the end of the ninetieth century, fruit production had
surpassed all other agricultural, mining, and timbering activity. The growth
of Silicon Valley occurred upon some of California's most fertile lands. A
survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture designated 400 square
kilometers---32 percent---of Santa Clara County as Class 1 land, the highest
ranking possible for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables. Water systems
flowing into the valley carved out rich alluvial fans in the Valley. Below
topsoil loam---in some places measuring forty feet deep---are gravel and clay
freshwater aquifers, which nineteenth century farmers reached with artesian
wells that provided a consistent supply of fresh water.[^cf39] Santa Clara
Valley farms remained relatively small. In 1900, the typical farm was under
fifty acres; in 1920, the average farm size as forty acres and dropped to
thirty-two acres by 1950.[^cf40] Agricultural activity by the 1940s witnessed
around 6,000 farms in the Valley, mostly family--run operations, that totaled
around 132,000 acres and some eight million cherry, apricot, and pear
trees.[^cf41]

The Bay Area's mid-century environmentalists treated nature as a place of
pristine beauty and predominantly rural. When Wallace Stegner lamented the
disappearing beauty of "this brief Eden," it was the human-built agricultural
landscape he looked upon.[^cf42] Frequent charges were made against
urbanization as environmentalists ridiculed the spread of cities by a
juxtaposition of the city against country. The orchards, farmlands,
equestrianism, open space, green belts, ranching, and rolling hills were
"nature," and the spread of cities into these areas were affronts to their
sensibilities. Nature, to the Bay Area's environmentalists, was normative. In the
story below, we find traces of what people thought was natural. But the
various features of the landscape---bulldozers, acres of fruit trees, arid
climate, water---all have a role to play in Silicon Valley. We cannot begin to
understand this place's history without understanding its environmental
components.

The San Francisco Peninsula followed---and in some ways led---the nation's
shift in population moving westward. The location of World War II military
facilities drew millions to the Far West. But it also followed another wartime
trend---the militarization of industry. The twentieth-century American West,
according to Kevin Fernlund, "bristled with airfields, army bases, naval
yards, marine camps, missile fields, nuclear test sites, proving grounds,
bombing ranges, weapons plants, military reservations, training schools, toxic
waste dumps, strategic mines, transportation routes, lines of communication,
laboratories, command centers, and arsenals." The burgeoning industrial and
military landscape in the West demanded a population to support it. California
alone accounted for the most dramatic increase in population due to the
militarization of its economy.[^cf43]

Postwar prosperity encouraged widespread growth across the country. By the
1950s many American cities experienced sprawling suburbanization, but what was
initially seen as a fulfillment of the American dream of homeownership became
viewed as an environmental disaster. Critics took aim at suburban growth and
environmental destruction, and nowhere was this change more obvious than in
the West. Metropolitan growth doubled the population in the region between
1940 and 1960. By the 1980s, the region was among the fastest growing in the
nation.[^cf44] Many westerners were unsettled by population growth, and raised
concerns about the disappearance of rural landscapes being replaced by
sprawl.[^cf45] Western political leaders such as Oregon Governor Thomas McCall
condemned what he called "sagebrush suburbs" and sought limits on urban growth
in the state. Anti--growth and environmental sentiments lay behind Bay Area
residents placing new limits on urban growth and condemning boosters that
supported plans for urban expansion.

The Bay Area witnessed some of the most dramatic urban growth. During the
1940s, Santa Clara County experienced 66% growth in population, compared to a
California wide growth of 53%. By the 1950s those figures surged upward; the
population increased 121% in Santa Clara County compared to 49% statewide.
Subdivisions sprang up to accommodate the influx of new residents. Most of
these new subdivisions were located beyond existing city boundaries in
unincorporated areas. Between 1945 and 1950 county farmland decreased from
727,000 acres to 589,000---a reduction of 81%.[^cf46] During that same period,
Bay Area cities engaged in rapid annexations. San Jose annexed land thirty-two
times between 1945 and 1950. During the same period, the City of Santa Clara
annexed only four tracts, but in 1951 annexed six tracts and another nine in
1952. Santa Clara added 50 acres to the city in two years. In the same two
year period, San Jose annexed sixteen parcels that totaled over 1000
acres.[^cf47] Between 1945 and 1970, San Jose approved over 1,400 annexations
and expanded the city's footprint from fifteen square miles to 135 square
miles. The city's land area expanded by 900 percent.[^cf48]

Populations surged simultaneously with industrial development. The combination
of defense industries, electronics research and development contracts, Cold
War defense agendas, abundant and inexpensive land, and cities willing and
able to support the rapid expansion of city infrastructure welcomed the
arrival of new industries. Industrial development began in the 1940s when the
National Advisory Committee on Aeronautics started construction of the Ames
Research Laboratory new Moffett Airfield. Stanford University leased its large
land holdings to industrial entrepreneurs and researchers who were active in
developing electronics equipment for military purposes. In just five years
after the end of World War II, fifty new electronics industries began in the
Valley. International Business Machines (IBM) established a card printing
plant in 1948 in San Jose, and Russell and Sigurd Varian, inventors of the
klystron tube, founded Varian Associates to manufacture devices.[^cf49] Other
industrial developers founded their companies on what would become the
Stanford Industrial Park in the late 1950s.

Such Industrial development was widely welcomed and considered a preferred
alternative to the dirty industry of the Northeast and Midwest. The
so-considered "clean" industries held the appearance of suburban areas with
broad lawns, trees, low-rise buildings, and hidden parking lots. Thanks to
strict building guidelines laid out by Stanford University as well as city
regulations on new construction, new high technology industries appeared more
like a college campus than an industrial manufacturer or research center. But
the promise of clean industry proved elusive as smog, radiation, water
contamination, intense energy and water usage, traffic congestion, and rising
housing and utility costs became common features of living in the Valley.

The costs of this negligence became most obvious in the 1980s, when cancer
clusters and birth defects emerged among residents in San Jose. Investigators
traced the source of the illnesses back to Fairchild Camera and Instrument
Company, whose solvents waste storage tanks had leaked 60,000 gallons of
solvent toxics into groundwater supplies.[^cf50] The water in the aquifers
remain unusable today. Santa Clara County currently has the highest count of
Superfund sites of any other county in the United States, amounting to
twenty--five locations requiring long--term cleanup of hazardous materials. The
majority of superfund sites resulted from high--tech firms in the Valley.

Writing about environmental politics in the Bay Area also offers us ways to
think about local politics. It might, as Richard Hofstadter once said, have
"something to say that might help us."[^cf51] The story here is, ultimately,
about the practice of politics in postwar America. Around kitchen tables,
within ad hoc coalitions, in letter campaigns and newspaper editorials, people
talked about the changing environment around them. Amenities and cultural
ideals about the Bay Area---climate, atmosphere, suburban, middle-class---had
attracted newcomers and delighted old--timers. But the rise of industry, the
influx of new residents, the explosion of suburban development, and the
devastation of orchards led both groups to question what sort of changes they
were welcoming to the Valley. Some of these organizations were short-lived,
such as the Citizens Committee on Regional Planning or United Palo Altans,
while others existed much longer to continue influencing California politics,
such as California Tomorrow and the Committee for Green Foothills. These
environmental organizations emerged directly from environmental changes
occurring in Silicon Valley.

Simultaneously, entrepreneurs, urban planners, university administrators, and
city leaders offered an alternative vision to the landscape: one that was
increasingly urban and industrial rather than rural and agricultural. Often
times support for growth was couched in the language of national defense: Cold
War defense spending poured into Stanford University, for example, which
eagerly sought out military contracts in research and development. Stanford
administrators responded to citizens critiques of land development programs by
dismissing their concerns as less important than national defense concerns.
Unrestricted urban growth and economic development characterized much of Santa
Clara Valley in the latter half of the twentieth century. California voters
became increasingly aware of the environmental considerations urban growth and
industrial development had for the region, leading to political activism, new
environmental regulation laws, and community referendums. Furthermore,
environmental groups criticized high technology firms and city leaders for
their ignorance of ecological negligence.[^cf52]

The research is undergirded by digital history methods, in particular the
project seeks to utilize textual analysis and spatial analysis to more deeply
understand the political, cultural, and environmental issues at stake.
My own thinking in digital methods has been deeply influenced by my time as a
graduate student at the University of Nebraska--Lincoln and working as the
Academic Technology Specialist and affiliated staff at the Center for Spatial
and Textual Analysis at Stanford University. People at both institutions
taught me to think prudently about digital research methods, to think deeply
about uncertainty and complexity in humanistic data, and the problems that
attend these issues when visualizing and digitally analyzing historical
evidence.

Visualizations offer opportunities for provocation.  Digital history and the
visualization of historical evidence, according to Richard White, is deeply
scholarly. White notes that

> Visualization and spatial history are not about producing illustrations or
> maps to communicate things that you have discovered by other means. It is a
> means of doing research; it generates questions that might otherwise go
> unasked, it reveals historical relations that might otherwise go unnoticed,
> and it undermines, or substantiates, stories upon which we build our own
> versions of the past.[^cf53]

Much of the data collected for this project exists online, as do various
visualizations and analysis tools. I strongly encourage readers to consult the
digital methods in addition to the text, or otherwise miss significant parts
of the story. [These are coming soon.]

Silicon Valley has become a cultural center in the United States; the wealth,
political influence, environmental precedence, and place in the American
imagination has led the Valley to take on an almost mystical quality in
American life. Cities and universities across the country and across the world
try and mimic the success of Silicon Valley and Stanford University. The
Valley is synonymous with the technology industry, an industry that has taken
on ever increasing importance to the nation's economy. Ideals about Silicon
Valley are embedded in cultural and institutional arenas in America. Observers
talk about "life hacks" or are pursuing ways to "disrupt higher education." By
asking new questions of the Valley's history, this work's digital component
seeks to probe the public to think more about Silicon Valley and its attendant
costs.

The history is also about the history that Silicon Valley has inherited. The
Valley often thinks of itself as outside of history---always looking to the
future, at the forefront of change and progress. But the organization and
imagination of Silicon Valley---its landscape, its space, its
relationships---are inseparable from its past. People here live with its
history daily. We must recognize how desires for beauty, nature, and pleasure
shape our spatial history, landscape, and nostalgia are embodied in cities.
Landscapes, the novelist Italo Calvino reminds us in *Invisible Cities*, are
"like lines on a hand, wirtten in the corners of the streets and the gratings
of the buildings."^[Italo Calvino, *Invisible Cities*, trans. (New York:
Harcourt Brace and Company, 1974), 11.] Cities and the nature that surrounds
them, that is embedded in them, are reflections of our desires. To build
better cities and protect nature reflect the ways we make landscapes match our
aspirations.

intellectual technology embodied the postindustrial economy. Economic
well--being was measured by quality of life measured by services and amenities
rather than the quality of goods. Historian Hal Rothman, economist Thomas

environmental historians including Josephy Taylor, Mark Fiege, Nancy Langston,
and William DeBuys, who reject any hard division between culture and natural.
Instead, they examine how forces shape and inform landscapes. Kenneth Olwig
has argued that landscape is substantive, where "environment, economics, law,
and culture are all important," and symbolic, "to be perceived, read, and
interpreted on the ground, in written texts, and through artistic images."

nature while disregarding less--striking landscapes. See William Cronon, "The
