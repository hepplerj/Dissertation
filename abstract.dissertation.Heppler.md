Using Silicon Valley as a case study, this dissertation examines how 
activists influenced by the environmental movement reconfigured urban 
culture in the American West.

My dissertation examines the environmental, economic, and cultural conflicts 
over the suburbanization and postindustrialization of California's Santa Clara 
Valley -- today known as Silicon Valley -- between 1940 and 2000. High 
technology industrialization emerged as a key component of economic and urban 
development in postwar era, particularly in western states seeking to 
diversify their economic activities. Industrialization produced thousands of 
new jobs, but development proved problematic when faced with competing views 
about land use. The natural allure that accompanied the thousands coming West 
gave rise to a modern environmental movement calling for strict limitations on 
urban growth, the preservation of open spaces, and pollution reduction. These 
views on land use lay at the center of these conflicts. Conflict over the 
Santa Clara Valley's land use tells the story not only of Silicon Valley's 
development, but Americans' changing understanding of nature and the 
environmental costs of urban and industrial development.
