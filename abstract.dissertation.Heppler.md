Using Silicon Valley as a case study, this dissertation examines how 
activists influenced by the environmental movement reconfigured urban 
culture in the American West.

My dissertation examines the environmental, economic, and cultural conflicts 
over the suburbanization and postindustrialization of California's Santa Clara 
Valley -- today known as Silicon Valley -- between 1940 and 2000. High 
technology industrialization emerged as a key component of economic and urban 
development in postwar era, particularly in western states seeking to 
diversify their economic activities. Industrialization produced thousands of 
new jobs, but development proved problematic when faced with competing views 
about land use. The natural allure that accompanied the thousands coming West 
gave rise to a modern environmental movement calling for strict limitations on 
urban growth, the preservation of open spaces, and pollution reduction. These 
views on land use lay at the center of these conflicts. Conflict over the 
Santa Clara Valley's land use tells the story not only of Silicon Valley's 
development, but Americans' changing understanding of nature and the 
environmental costs of urban and industrial development.

This dissertation explores the political, economic and environmental transformations of the region stretching from the metropolitan areas of Boston to Washington, D.C. from World War II through the 1970s. Looking at urban, suburban, and vacationland locations throughout the Northeast Corridor, I examine the histories of housing development, urban renewal, highway construction, and land use policy during the early postwar period when policy makers and citizens shared an orthodoxy about the benefits of unchecked growth as well as in later years when this orthodoxy came under siege. The project focuses especially on the critics of growth, including civil rights activists, environmentalists, city and regional planners, and suburban growth-control advocates. By the late 1960s and early 1970s this heterogeneous collection of activists and policy makers created a politics of development new in both substance and style. Especially when environmental concerns took center stage, growth's critics sometimes created unlikely coalitions that secured alternative growth policies, for example regarding transportation in metropolitan Boston, suburban sprawl in Montgomery County, Maryland, and dam and recreation development in the upper Delaware River valley. However, the whole turned out to be less than the sum of its parts. More frequently, growth's critics collided both with one another and with other popular political impulses such as those seeking to protect property values, preserve local home rule, and resist economic and racial integration. I conclude that growth's critics ultimately achieved only limited success, as an examination of the fifteen-year reign of New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller demonstrates. Simultaneously and unapologetically a pro-growth booster and a champion of many growth critiques, Rockefeller and his administration carried on his family's long history of racial liberalism and conservationism by fighting discrimination, physically revitalizing poor urban neighborhoods, cleaning waterways, and preserving open space while at the same time actively dismissing more radical black and environmental critiques that held these efforts to be too timid, gradualist, and narrowly focused. This dissertation shows how, in New York and elsewhere on the Northeast Corridor, moderate critiques of growth came to co-exist with rather than replace prior growth patterns and policies. Growth was reformed but not transformed. ^
