At Stanford, I have benefited from another rich community of ideas and thinkers. My colleagues have been wonderful friends, inquisitive thinkers, and indefinitely helpful. Maria __, Glauco ___, Nicole Coleman, Mikael Wolfe, Katie McDonough, Cameron Blevins, Richard White, Zephyr Frank, Nick Bauch, have all served as sounding boards for my ideas. I'm grateful for the time you've offered to listen to my ideas, the probing questions you've asked, and the encouragement you've provided.
