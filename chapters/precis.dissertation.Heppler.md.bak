*After meeting with my committee before I left for Stanford and having a chance to dig more deeply into source material, I've reframed aspects of the dissertation project that I am outlining below. The committee pushed me to think more about what sort of story I was trying to tell (urban? cultural? science and technology?) and urged me to do a broad survey into newspapers and other sources to get a clearer idea of the sort of issues people in Santa Clara Valley were discussing.*

*The story I wanted to tell from the outset was an urban history, and the committee left me asking the question: "What attends technology"? One answer that I came across in source material was: environmental change. Specifically, the issue of water became a key point in discussions about urban change and industrial growth in Santa Clara Valley. The legacy of these environmental issues remains with the Valley today, but the story has seldom been explored by historians or journalists. What follows is a slight reframing of the dissertation, including what I feel is much greater clarity as to my topic, a much better handle on the available source material, and a tighter argument that will keep the dissertation from becoming too multi-varied or lengthy. Below outlines a revised project narrative, potential chapters, and an annotated list of archival sources relating to those topics.*

\begin{abstract}
This dissertation examines the environmental, economic, and cultural conflicts over high tech industrial development in California's Santa Clara Valley between 1950 and 1990. High technology manufacturing emerged as a dominant industrial activity in the second half of the twentieth century, particularly in California. As part of a larger wave of postindustrial manufacturing throughout the United States, postindustrial capitalism challenged the federal management of western water resources as urban and industrial demand for water increased following World War II. Growing affluence and educational levels in postwar America drew thousands of residents to the Bay Area; coupled with industrial demands for water, California political leaders and federal officials sought ways to provide the state its water needs. But the development of new water policies and water projects proved problematic in the face of competing views over water management. The same allure that drew people to Santa Clara Valley also gave rise to a modern environmental movement that called for the preservation of wilderness, limits on urban and suburban growth, and reduction of pollution. These two views on nature -- one for the good of industrial and urban growth, the other for nature's sustainability -- came into increasing conflict particularly around industrial development. By the 1970s, critics denounced the environmental impact upon western water resources. Over four decades, political battles over the environmental, social, and economic impacts of industrial development raged through California. Water had become so key in political battles that state voters rejected the construction of aqueduct projects, supported new laws {such as???}, and community members formed a local environmental movement -- the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) -- to provide a public and legal voice for the Valley's citizens. The story of Silicon Valley and water is not just a story of California, but Americans' changing understanding of the environmental costs of urban and industrial development and an awareness of the scarcity of a natural resource.

Watering the Valley examines the role of the federal government in fostering the development of high technology and the emergence of the new postindustrial West, where lands became more valuable as industry than cropland, causing a transformation from once rural valley into sprawling urban community reliant on the high technology industry

Looking back on the four decades since William Hewlett and Richard Packard founded their high technology company in a Palo Alto garage, the *San Jose Mercury*, the city's oldest newspaper, surveyed ten causes of Silicon Valley's success. One of those causes was environmental: water. Beginning in 1965, water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta flowed forty-four miles through the South Bay Aqueduct, bringing {number} gallons of water to {location}. Sig Sanchez, the director of the Santa Clara Valley Water District in the 1990s, recalled the project's importance to Silicon Valley. "It was our first import project, and it was essential to the growth we were anticipating," he remarked. "The valley would have grown, but not at the rate it has, because we would not have been able to accommodate the Silicon Valley."^["Water made orchards, silicon chip industry sprout faster," *San Jose Mercury*, December 22, 1999.] Water and economic growth went hand in hand.

Three large water projects would eventually bring a consistent source of fresh water into Santa Clara Valley. Twenty years after the South Bay Aqueduct, the San Felipe water system would be constructed through Pacheco Pass to move water out of the San Joaquin Valley. Additionally, the Santa Clara Valley consumed water from the Hetch Hetchy system, which today supplies about half the water used throughout the Bay Area.^[As of 1996, 42 percent of the Valley's water comes from local reserviors, 23 percent from the federal Central Valley Project (delivery of water started in 1987), 19 percent from the State Water Project (deliver started in 1965), and 16 percent purchased from the Hetch Hetchy acqueduct. @matthews2003dreams, p. 104.] Additional water conservation projects, including dams, reservoirs, percolation ponds, canals, and runoff capture, together helped provide the Valley with its water demands. James Lenihan, who served on the water conservation board in the 1960s and later served on the board for the Santa Clara Valley Water District, credited water project success on the absence of an environmental movement. "With the environmental movement, we would never have been able to do now what we did then," he said. "We were able to get it in place before the movement came along to say no more reservoirs, no pipelines, no aqueducts."^["Water made orchards, silicon chip industry sprout faster," *San Jose Mercury*, December 22, 1999.]

![Silicon Valley. The Santa Clara Valley lies between the Santa Cruz Mountains on the west and the Diablo Range to the east, largely encompassing the municipalities of San Jose, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Redwood City. Between 1945 and 2000, San Jose became the largest city in the Bay Area and ranked the near the top of population growth in the nation.](figures/sv.png)

Unrestricted urban growth and economic development characterized much of Santa Clara Valley in the latter half of the twentieth century, but little told is the story of the environmental consequences of Silicon Valley and those who attempted to shape the conversation about the region's ecological future.[On the rise of the modern environmental movement, see @hays1987beauty, pp. 13--39; @rothman2000saving, pp. 131--159; @steinberg2002earth, pp. 239--261; @opie1998nature, pp. 404--433.] California voters became increasingly aware of the environmental considerations urban growth and industrial development had for their region, leading by the mid-1970s to voters rejecting new large-scale water projects. Furthermore, environmental groups such as the Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club, and the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition began criticizing high technology firms and city leaders for their ignorance of ecological negligence. The costs of this negligence became most obvious in the 1980s, when cancer clusters and birth defects emerged among residents in San Jose. Investigators traced the source of the illnesses back to Fairchild Camera and Instrument Company, whose solvents waste storage tanks had leaked 60,000 gallons into groundwater supplies.^[Local and federal studies discovered that trichloroethane, a common industrial solvent used in the cleaning of semiconductor parts, was leaking out of storage takes and into groundwater. The problem was not limited to Fairchild; other high technology plants had similar issues. Health effects of consuming the contaminated water ranged from liver and kidney damage to skin rashes. "U.S. to Study Pollution in High-Technology Area," *New York Times* October 30, 1983, p. 33. For a summary of the history regarding groundwater contamination, see @colten1991contamination.] The water in the aquifers remain unusable today.

I argue that to understand water and its relationship to Silicon Valley we can examine three contested landscapes in the Bay Area: natural, suburban, and industrial. These contests over water took place within competing landscapes in California. The Bay Area -- indeed, much of the American West -- experiences hybrid landscapes that reveal a cultural ideology that accepts conflicting uses for natural resources. Through examining these three hybrid landscapes that express the different ways in which people constructed different water use programs to fit human cultural and economic needs, I argue the underlying and conflicting interconnectedness of these landscapes has exacted significant costs from the Bay Area's human population and natural ecology. The story told here stands at the intersections of postindustrial society, environmental history, and the spatial politics of suburbanization and economic development.^[In his classic work, *Coming of the Post-Industrial Society*, sociologist Daniel Bell argued that the shift from a goods-producing economy to a service-based economy, the rise of a professional and technical class, the centrality of knowledge as the source of innovation, and the creation of intellectual technology embodied the postindustrial economy. Economic well-being was measured by quality of life measured by services and amenities rather than the quality of goods. Historian Hal Rothman, economist Thomas Michael Power, and geographer William Wyckoff have explored the larger ramifications of this shift in the American West. See @bell1999coming, 14; @rothman1997devils, 17; @power1996lostlandscapes; @wyckoff1995postindustrial, 478--496.]

Landscape is the physical result of people constructing places for diverse purposes. Landscape is also a way of seeing the land, a perspective that emphasizes aspects of the geography that appeal to beauty, economy, or culture. Sand dunes, for example, once obstacles to travel, are now playgrounds for off-road enthusiasts. Landscapes are created both physically and mentally according to our preferences and experiences. In turn, these expectations shape and reshape the environment. The result is what Richard White has called a hybrid landscape, a landscape not purely wild or built but instead a construction of natural and cultural systems that shape and create place.[@white2004hybrid. In surveying the trends in environmental history, Richard White reviewed the works of several environmental historians including Josephy Taylor, Mark Fiege, Nancy Langston, and William DeBuys, who reject any hard division between culture and natural. Instead, they examine how forces shape and inform landscapes. Kenneth Olwig has argued that landscape is substantive, where "environment, economics, law, and culture are all important," and symbolic, "to be perceived, read, and interpreted on the ground, in written texts, and through artistic images." @sauer2008morphology, p. 100; @olwig1996recovering, p. 645; @meinig1979beholding, pp. 43--45; @basso1996wisdom, p. 110. William Cronon has argued the same phenomenon happens when Americans construct and then preserve wilderness to suit ideas of sublime nature while disregarding less-striking landscapes. See @cronon1996troublewilderness.]

Geographer John Wright has argued that "places are best seen as shifting stages where the exercise of power and resistance to it vie for dominance."[@wright2003musculature, p. 85.] Physical and conceptual boundaries were drawn around competing water landscapes in the Bay Area. These boundaries encapsulated four landscapes: agriculture, high technology, and urban growth and development. These intermixed landscapes placed unique but concurrent pressures on water resources in the Bay Area, introducing ramifications not only at the local and state level but also the national level. In examining the human and environmental costs of electronics and urban development, this study evaluates the costs of these programs. Although this study is tightly focused on a specific region, it has greater bearing on understanding the inherent tension between local and national politics and Americans' growing awareness of environmental issues. In the Santa Clara Valley, the development of new landscapes, resulting from various perceptions of the region as farmland, electronics manufacturer, urban oasis, and tourist destination shaped the use of water in the valley.

The growth of Silicon Valley occurred upon some of California's most fertile lands. A survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in {YEAR} designated 400 square kilometers -- 32 percent -- of Santa Clara County as Class 1 land, the highest ranking possible for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables. Water systems fed into the valley, supplied by streams flowing down to the San Francisco Bay from the Diablo Range and Santa Cruz Mountains that carved out alluvial fans in the Valley. Below topsoil loam -- in some places measuring 40 feet deep -- are gravel and clay and freshwater aquifers, which nineteenth century farmers reached with artesian wells that provided a consistent supply of water.[@sachs1999ecology, p. 15.] Agricultural activity by the 1940s witnessed around 6,000 farms in the Valley, mostly family-run operations, that totaled around 132,000 acres and some eight million cherry, apricot, and pear trees.[@sachs1999ecology, p. 16.]

By the 1970s, the water situation had changed in the Valley. What was once abundant and seemingly limitless had become scarce under the twin demands of urban growth and industrial development. Computer chip manufacturing is a highly water-intensive industry. An analyst for Texas Instruments estimated in the 1980s that creating a single 15-centimeter silicon wafer (used as the basis of electronic chips) required 8,610 liters of water in the manufacturing process.[@sachs1999ecology, p. 16.] Chip manufacturing in 2013 requires even greater amounts of water, including the use of an ultra-purified water used as a cleaning agent created from regular tap water. This ultraclean water is unhealthy for human consumption, akin to poison; it's so efficient that it will leach minerals directly from human tissue.[@fishman2011thirst pp. 47-48. Given the incredibly small scale of chip manufacturing, chip makers cannot risk minerals and particles in water damaging soldering. Hence, ultra pure water is used to wash away any potential particles.] Urban development likewise placed new pressure on water as residents demanded access for their day to day lives, for their lawns, for recreation. The combination of intense water usage by industry and the need to support suburban communities meant by the 1970s, for the first time, the county needed to start importing water.

Water became a linchpin in contests over power conflicts: who controlled water, who had access to water, how water should and could be used. The valley's agricultural past required access to water to support orchard fields. Later in the twentieth century, water became key to semiconductor manufacturers, who used an ultra-purified water in the process of manufacturing electronics components. Supporting urban growth offered a third theme in contests over water, as the valley's population exploded in the mid-twentieth century. And finally, residents new and old made demands on water as recreation. Dam projects by the state of California in and around the Santa Clara Valley became tied to recreation and tourism while simultaneously supporting other water projects for manufacturing and urban growth. As water demands rose, it also gave growth to a modern environmental movement that challenged suburban sprawl, industrial development, and recreation in the Bay Area while also breathing life into environmental movements across the nation.

Efforts by federal regulators, city officials, business leaders, and farmers all attempted to maximize their access to water. Beginning in the 1930s, orchard fields in the Santa Clara Valley became national producers of prunes, cherries, peaches, and apricots. The growing agricultural presence in the Bay Area made demands on local water resources and led federal officials and state political leaders to pursue water and irrigation projects that would sustain farmlands. Yet by the 1930s so much water was being pumped out of underground water basins that Stanford geologists discovered Santa Clara Valley had sunk four feet in just twenty years.^["Data Show Sinking of Bay Area," *Los Angeles Times*, March 20, 1934, p. 1. The process of land sinking is known as subsidence and results from the weight of land compacting underground sand and gravel aquifers that have been drained. Subsidence would not end until 1969; by then, downtown San Jose had sunk ten feet and Alviso along the coastal bay had sunk thirteen feet.] Concerns over the Valley's access to water led to the development of the Central Valley Project in the late 1930s.

Postwar prosperity encouraged widespread growth across the country. By the 1950s a majority of American cities achieved wide growth, but what was initially seen as a fulfillment of the American dream of homeownership became viewed as an environmental disaster. Critics took aim at suburban growth and environmental destruction, and nowhere was this change more obvious than in the West. Metropolitan growth doubled the population in the region between 1940 and 1960. Many westerners were unsettled by population growth, and raised concerns about the disappearance of rural landscapes being replaced by sprawl.^[On the emergence of sprawl in the Bay Area, see @walker2001industry; @omara2005cities, pp. 57--94.] Western political leaders such as Oregon Governor Thomas McCall condemned what he called "sagebrush suburbs" and sought limits on urban growth in the state. Other anti-growth sentiments lay behind California voters rejecting improvement plans to the Central Valley Water Project in 1973 and legal battles with Fairchild Semiconductor regarding groundwater contamination. By the 1980s, the region was among the fastest growing in the nation.[On environmental concerns over suburbanization see: @jackson1985crabgrass; @rome2001bulldozer.]

![Water waste](figures/money_waste.jpg)

The urban expansion of the Bay Area and its demands for water resources coincided with the growing environmental movement in America. Beginning in the 1960s, environmental groups like Sierra Club became politically active. The Wilderness Act of 1964 likewise brought greater attention to the nation's environmental issues. By the late 1960s, the environmental movement had become "a mass movement organized around cleaner air and water for all, not just in wilderness areas."[@steinberg2002earth, p. 240.] Books about the environment became best sellers, notably Rachel Carlson's *Silent Spring* and Paul and Anne Ehrlich's *The Population Bomb*. Other legislative actions, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, reflected growing concerns over environmental issues.[@hays1987beauty, pp. 13--39; @opie1998nature, pp. 404--433; @rothman2000saving, pp. 131-159; @steinberg2002earth, pp. 250--257.] Despite Lenihan's claim of the environmental movement's absence, the movement was indeed active in the Valley and expressed itself not only through advocacy groups but through California voters who rejected new large-scale water projects, urban development programs, and industrial growth plans that were not sensitive to ecological concerns.

# Organization

The dissertation is organized chronologically and thematically. Each chapter is roughly chronological to one another, but thematic in their narrative to explore the Valley's relationship to western water.

## Chapter 1: The Valley of Heart's Delight: The Natural-Suburban-Industrial Landscapes

Chapter 1 will set the stage for the mid-twentieth century. The chapter will begin by sketching out the three hybrid landscapes that existed in California: the agricultural landscape, the urban landscape, and the industrial landscape. As noted above, these landscapes were conceptual and physical constructions. The chapter will also introduce readers to the history leading up postwar California, and lay the groundwork found in agriculture, mining, and timbering operations that demanded large amounts of water. The chapter will largely be a general look at water in California prior to 1945. Chapter 2 will start a more focused examination of the Valley's history. The rest of the chapter lays out the rest of the groundwork by surveying urban growth and industrial growth, charting the rise of electronics manufacturing in Santa Clara County beginning in the early twentieth century and will end after World War II. This will be key to examining the early industrial work being built up by Stanford University. Chapter 1 brings the story up to the post-agricultural, postwar suburban and industrial development, which will be the primary focus of this dissertation. 

### Sources

A variety of sources exist to help tell the story of water's centrality to California's history. Since the opening chapter is largely a survey of water in California, this chapter will survey the historiography of western water and California water, but will also include primary sources largely drawn from newspaper accounts and some archival sources.

* *Los Angeles Times*
* *New York Times*
* *Palo Alto Times*
* *San Francisco Chronicle*

## Chapter 2: "Carved from a Forest of Fruit Trees": Suburbs and the Water Landscape

Joe Ruscigno, a lifetime farmer and resident of the Valley, had started a new occupation in 1952. "Guess I've pulled out 150 acres of trees since the first of the year," he told the *San Francisco Chronicle*. Ruscigno lamented the uprooting of the prune trees to the bulldozer he now sat upon, but "what can you do? . . . The subdivisions were coming in all around us and when they made a good offer I sold out."^["Santa Clara County -- Scene of the Big Boom," *San Francisco Chronicle*, May 11, 1952.] Chapter 3 builds chronologically from the previous chapters and extends the story into the postwar years. The chapter will focus primarily on urban growth between 1945 and 1965, and examine how new residents attempted to exert changes upon water resources in order to support the growing cities. To keep the story focused, the chapter will use the city of San Jose as a case study. San Jose exemplified changes occurring in other Peninsula cities and will examine urban growth and its encroachment upon natural water features and new demands on municipal water supplies. 

## Chapter 3: Machines in the Garden: The Electronics Industry

Beginning in the mid-1950s, Stanford began attracting high technology industry to the Stanford Industrial Park, established to promote research and developments of electronics. Built primarily on the backs of defense contracts, the Park became a hub of intellectual and manufacturing activity and kicked off a wave of new industrial growth that spread south through Santa Clara Valley. Just as suburban homes demanded new amenities for lawns and recreation, so did businesses require water for aesthetics and production. The construction of business parks also meant bulldozing under wetlands, flood plains, and creeks to make room for development.

## Chapter 4: How Clean is Clean? Water and the Myth of Clean Industry

High technology manufacturing had billed itself as a "clean" industry, in contrast to the smokestacks of the Midwest and Northeast industrial belt. 

In 1983, responding to the discovery of chemical contamination of ground water from semiconductor industries, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans for a $500,000 study of Silicon Valley to examine the effects of industrial pollution.^["U.S. to study Pollution in High-Technology Area," *New York Times* October 30, 1983, p. 33; "High-Tech: A Stain on a 'Clean' Field," *Los Angeles Times* December 22, 1983, pp. 14, 18.] 

## Chapter 5: The End of the Boom

The final chapter will examine
