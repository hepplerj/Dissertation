Chapter 1 will set the stage for the mid-twentieth century. The chapter will begin by sketching out the three hybrid landscapes that existed in California: the agricultural landscape, the urban landscape, and the industrial landscape. As noted above, these landscapes were conceptual and physical constructions. The chapter will also introduce readers to the history leading up postwar California, and lay the groundwork found in agriculture, mining, and timbering operations that demanded large amounts of water. The chapter will largely be a general look at water in California prior to 1945. Chapter 2 will start a more focused examination of the Valley's history. The rest of the chapter lays out the rest of the groundwork by surveying urban growth and industrial growth, charting the rise of electronics manufacturing in Santa Clara County beginning in the early twentieth century and will end after World War II. This will be key to examining the early industrial work being built up by Stanford University. Chapter 1 brings the story up to the post-agricultural, postwar suburban and industrial development, which will be the primary focus of this dissertation.
