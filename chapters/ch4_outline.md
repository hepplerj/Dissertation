This chapter will examine the events and causes of new water conservation policies for residential communities. I argue that the changing economic and regulatory conditions facing suburbs led to a period of new conservation policies and local political measures. Local eco-justice groups -- the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC), GrassRoots Recycling Network, Mercury Policy Project, and Clean Water Action -- pressured industry and urban policies to account for environmental negligence and the impact it had on land and water. The chapter will examine how these local politics were implemented, and how city leaders responded to political pressures. Such measures included ending the recruitment of new industry to the area, beginning in 1970 when the County Chamber of Commerce's $147,000 budget was slashed in half by the city Board of Supervisors.[1] The final chapter will end in the 1990s before the dot-com bubble shifts the focus of the electronics industry to networked computers.
