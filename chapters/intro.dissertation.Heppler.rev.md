> The underlying principle of conservation has been described as the application of common sense to common problems for the common good. If the description is correct, then conservation is the great fundamental basis for national efficiency. In this stage of the world's history to be fearless, to be just, and to be efficient are the three great requirements of national life. National efficiency is the result of natural resources well handled, of freedom of opportunity for every man, and of the inherent capacity, trained ability, knowledge and will, collectively and individually to use that opportunity."

Looking back on the four decades since William Hewlett and Richard Packard founded their high technology company in a Palo Alto garage, the *San Jose Mercury*, the city's oldest newspaper, through a series of articles surveyed ten causes of Silicon Valley's success. One of those causes was environmental: water. Beginning in 1965, water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta flowed forty-four miles through the South Bay Aqueduct, bringing {number} gallons of water to {location}. Sig Sanchez, who was serving as the director of the Santa Clara Valley Water District in the 1990s, recalled the project's importance to Silicon Valley. "It was our first import project, and it was essential to the growth we were anticipating," he remarked. "The valley would have grown, but not at the rate it has, because we would not have been able to accommodate the Silicon Valley."^["Water made orchards, silicon chip industry sprout faster," *San Jose Mercury*, December 22, 1999.] Water and economic growth went hand in hand.

Three large water projects would eventually bring a consistent source of fresh water into Santa Clara Valley. Twenty years after the South Bay Aqueduct, the San Felipe water system would be constructed through Pacheco Pass to move water out of the San Joaquin Valley. Additionally, the Valley consumed water from the Hetch Hetchy system, which today supplies about half the water used throughout the Bay. Additional water conservation projects, including dams, reservoirs, percolation ponds, canals, and runoff capture, together helped provide the Valley with its water needs. James Lenihan, who served on the water conservation board in the 1960s and later served on the board for the Santa Clara Valley Water District, credited water project success on the absence of an environmental movement. "With the environmental movement, we would never have been able to do now what we did then," he said. "We were able to get it in place before the movement came along to say no more reservoirs, no pipelines, no aqueducts."^["Water made orchards, silicon chip industry sprout faster," *San Jose Mercury*, December 22, 1999.]

Unrestricted urban growth and economic development characterized much of Santa Clara Valley in the latter half of the twentieth century, but little told is the story of the environmental consequences of Silicon Valley and those who attempted to shape the conversation about the region's ecological future.[On the rise of the modern environmental movement, see: @hays1987beauty, pp. 13--39; @rothman2000saving, pp. 131--159; @steinberg2002earth, pp. 239--261; @opie1998nature, pp. 404--433.] California voters became increasingly aware of the environmental considerations urban growth and industrial development had for their region, leading by 1973 to voters rejecting new large-scale water projects. Furthermore, environmental groups such as the Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club, and Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition criticized high technology firms and city leaders for their ignorance on environmental change. The costs of environmental negligence became most obvious in the 1980s, when cancer clusters emerged in San Jose. The source of the cancer clusters was traced back to semiconductor manufacturers, whose toxic waste storage tanks were discovered leaking and contaminating underground aquifers. The water in the aquifers are still unusable today.{source}

The story told here stands at the intersections of postindustrial society, environmental history, and the spatial politics of suburbanization and economic development. City leaders, residents, laborers, migrant workers, and others all experienced rapid urban change after World War II and responded in various ways to these changes. One consequence of these changes is the enormous demands made upon water resources in the Far West.

Silicon Valley has only just begun to attract attention of historians. Margaret O'Mara and John Findley have written the best accounts of Silicon Valley and its place in urban processes. But their stories focus on the institutional and cultural construction of Silicon Valley.

![Silicon Valley. The Santa Clara Valley lies between the Santa Cruz Mountains on the west and the Diablo Range to the east, largely encompassing the municipalities of San Jose, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Redwood City. Between 1945 and 2000, San Jose became the largest city in the Bay Area and ranked the near the top of population growth in the nation.](/Users/jheppler/acad/research/dissertation/figures/sv.png)

Metropolitan growth, annexations, and incorporations were so rapid that Robert Self called the process a "land rush."[@self2003american, p. 20.]

The study approaches political history at the local level. City leaders, activists, and residents shaped the implementation and interpretation of policies ...

In examining the human and environmental costs of water, electronics, outdoor recreation, urban development, and wilderness areas, this study evaluates the costs of these programs. Although this study is tightly focused on a specific region, it has greater bearing on understanding the inherent tension between local and national politics. In the Santa Clara Valley, the development of new landscapes, resulting from various perceptions of the region as farmland, electronics manufacturer, urban oasis, and tourist destination shaped the use of water in the valley.

Water and technology are icons in California. The battle over the Hetch Hetchy reservoir and the growth of environmentalism calls to mind the importance of water and its battles in the Far West, while the electronics industry has located its origin myth in the former orchard fields surrounding Stanford University. These two icons share the California landscape in ways not yet examined by historians. Although considered separate landscapes, they are entangled in ways not previously understood. Water and the Santa Clara Valley share what Richard White has called a hybrid landscape. Neither rural or urban, hybrid landscapes are complex creations of natural and cultural systems that shape a place.[@white2004hybrid. In surveying the trends in environmental history, Richard White reviewed the works of several environmental historians including Josephy Taylor, Mark Fiege, Nancy Langston, and William DeBuys, who reject any hard division between culture and natural. Instead, they examine how forces shape and inform landscapes. Kenneth Olwig has argued that landscape is substantive, where "enivronment, economics, law, and culture are all important," and smbolic, "to be perceived, read, and interpreted on the ground, in written texts, and through artistic images." @white2004hybrid; @sauer2008morphology, p. 100; @olwig1996recovering, p. 645; @meinig1979beholding, pp. 43--45; @basso1996wisdom, p. 110.]

Water became a linchpin in contests over power conflicts: who controlled water, who had access to water, how water should and could be used. The valley's agricultural past required access to water to support orchard fields. Later in the twentieth century, water became key to semiconductor manufacturers, who used an ultra-purified water in the process of manufacturing electronics components. Supporting urban growth offered a third theme in contests over water, as the valley's population exploded in the mid-twentieth century. And finally, residents new and old made demands on water as recreation. Dam projects by the state of California in and around the Santa Clara Valley became tied to recreation and tourism while simultaneously supporting other water projects for manufacturing and urban growth. As water demands rose, it also gave growth to a modern environmental movement that challenged suburban sprawl, industrial development, and recreation in the Bay Area while also breathing life into environmental movements across the nation.

Efforts by federal regulators, city officials, business leaders, and farmers all attempted to maximize their access to water. Beginning in the 1930s, orchard fields in the Santa Clara Valley became national producers of prunes, cherries, peaches, {more}. The growing agribusiness presence in the Bay Area made demands on local water resources and led federal officials and state political leaders to pursue water and irrigation projects that would sustain farmlands. Yet by the 1930s so much water was being pumped out of underground water basins that Stanford geologists discovered Santa Clara Valley had sunk four feet in just twenty years.^["Data Show Sinking of Bay Area," *Los Angeles Times*, March 20, 1934, p. 1. The process of land sinking is known as subsidence and results from the weight of land compacting underground sand and gravel aquifers that have been drained. Subsidence would not end until 1969; by then, downtown San Jose had sunk ten feet and Alviso along the coastal bay had sunk thirteen feet.] Concerns over the Valley's access to water led to the development of the Central Valley Project in the late 1930s.

South Bay Aqueduct and San Joaquin Valley Project, along with San Francisco's Hetch Hetchy reservoir, supplied over half the water to the Valley. The water projects were essential to support the growing suburbs, high tech industries, and agriculture in the Valley.

The story here re-situates how we understand Silicon Valley by placing the environment at the core of the story. {EXPAND}

Postwar prosperity encouraged widespread growth across the country. By the 1950s a majority of American cities achieved wide growth, but what was initially seen as a fulfillment of the American dream of homeownership became viewed as an environmental disaster. Critics took aim at suburban growth and environmental destruction, and nowhere was this change more obvious than in the West. Metropolitan growth doubled the population in the region between 1940 and 1960. Many westerners were unsettled by population growth, and raised concerns about the disappearance of rural landscapes being replaced by sprawl. Western political leaders such as Oregon Governor Thomas McCall condemned what he called "sagebrush suburbs" and sought limits on growth in the state. Other anti-growth sentiments emerged in {example}. By the 1980s, the region was among the fastest growing in the nation.[On environmental concerns over suburbanization see: @jackson1985crabgrass; @rome2001bulldozer.]

The urban expansion of the Bay Area and its demands for water resources coincided with the growing environmental movement in America. Beginning in the 1960s, environmental groups like Sierra Club became politically active. The Wilderness Act of 1964 likewise brought greater attention to the nation's environmental issues. By the late 1960s, the environmental movement had become "a mass movement organized around cleaner air and water for all, not just in wilderness areas."[@steinberg2002earth, p. 240.] Books about the environment became best sellers, notably Rachel Carlson's *Silent Spring* and Paul and Anne Ehrlich's *The Population Bomb*. Other legislative actions, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, reflected growing concerns over environmental issues.[@hays1987beauty, pp. 13--39; @opie1998nature, pp. 404--433; @rothman2000saving, pp. 131-159; @steinberg2002earth, pp. 250--257.]

# Water and the West

Historians of western America have long identified water as a central component in the region's historical experience. Frederick Jackson Turner .....

Walter Prescott Webb's classic The Great Plains (193?) revised Turner's telling of Western history and located in the Plains a different, if not outright hostile, environment --- an experience far different from the environment Turner's Americans experienced in the East. For Webb, water was a defining feature of the Great Plains: he bounded the region based on its precipitation; he recounted the region's troubles with agriculture and water use; he maintained the importance of irrigation projects; etc. Having no trees and scarce water, the Great Plains settlers

> Were thrown by Mother Necessity into the clutch of new circumstances. Their plight has been stated in this way: east of the Mississippi civilization stood on three legs--land, water, and timber; west of the Mississippi not one but two of these legs were withdrawn,--water and timber,--and civilization was left on one leg--land. It is small wonder that it toppled over in temporary failure.

Webb's settlers turned to underground aquifers -- their only source of substantial water -- and developed new methods for dealing with scarce resources: irrigation systems, new legal systems for allocating water rights. The prairie was "a land of survival where nature has most stubbornly resisted the efforts of man. Nature's very stubbornness has driven man to the innovations which he has made." Struggle against a resistant environment has been told by subsequent historians. James Malin's more ecologically sophisticated studies of the Plains tells a similar story of settlers moving from "forest man" to "grass man." Paul Bonnifield's The Dust Bowl provides a similar narrative of humans overcoming the environment.

# Postwar Western Demographics

The mobilization of the country in World War II dramatically altered the nation and people's daily lives. Following a decade of economic depression, people migrated to metropolitan areas to take new wartime industries. The American West especially felt the impact of this demographic shift, leading Carl Abbott to remark that launched "the entire West into the half-century of head-long urbanization."[@abbott1993metropolitan, p. 4.] Six of the largest western metropolitan areas grew in 1940 grew by 380% over the course of fifty years, compared to just 64% for the six largest in the East.[@abbott1993metropolitan, p. xiii.] Just as populations were migrating to metropolitan centers, the number of people living inside city boundaries was declining. The attraction of suburban life {EXPAND}

# The Bay Area

The San Francisco Bay Area is among the most highly populated places in the United States. The area is physiographically situated between the Santa Cruz mountains to the west and the Diablo Range to the east, a tightly compact area spanning only {MILES} across and {MILES} long. Hydrologically, the region is fed by several rivers and aquifers dominated by the {FACT}.

![Bay Area hydrology.](/Users/jheppler/acad/research/dissertation/figures/hydrology.png)

The Mediterranean climate of the Bay Area means the region receives very little rainfall outside of the period between November and April. Around seven percent of California land in 1951 was agricultural, and around half of that land required consistent irrigation.[@blaney_use_1951: 189.] On average, the semiarid Valley receives about 14 inches of rain annually.^["Water made orchards, silicon chip industry sprout faster," *San Jose Mercury*, December 22, 1999.]

# The Landscape of Conflict

Geographer John Wright argued that "places are best seen as shifting stages where the exercise of power and resistance to it vie for dominance."

Questioning the need for water projects at all.

# Organization

The dissertation is organized chronologically and thematically. Each chapter is roughly chronological to one another, but thematic in their narrative to explore the various processes and contests at work in the Valley. The themes are organized around irrigation, manufacturing, tourism, and urban growth.

**Chapter 1: The Western Water Landscape**

The water landscape

The urban landscape

The agricultural landscape

The industrial landscape


**Chapter 2: The Valley of Heart's Delight**

agriculture

**Chapter 3: "Carved from a Forest of Fruit Trees": Urban Growth and Water Resources**

urban

Joe Ruscigno, a lifetime farmer and resident of the Valley, had started a new occupation in 1952. "Guess I've pulled out 150 acres of trees since the first of the year," he told the San Francisco Chronicle. Ruscigno lamented the uprooting of the prune trees to the bulldozer he now sat upon, but "what can you do? . . . The subdivisions were coming in all around us and when they made a good offer I sold out."^["Santa Clara County -- Scene of the Big Boom," *San Francisco Chroncile*, May 11, 1952.] The Valley's suburbanization led to similar experiences as those by Ruscigno.

Chapter 3 builds chronologically from the previous chapter and extends the story into the World War II and postwar years. 

**Chapter 4: How Clean is Clean?**

Industry

**Chapter 5: Leisure, Recreation, and Water**

recreation

Just as urban and business resources were making greater demands on the Valley's water resources, a shift in thought about the utility of water resources became centered on the experiential value of outdoor recreational tourism. Recreation presented an opportunity to use water that could continue to fuel monetary values into the Valley.^[@shaffer2001america and @louter2006windshield. For a similar history of the national forests and the ways in which the American public interacted with them through activities such as skiing, hiking, and camping see @sutter2002driven, @wolf2008carhart, @childers2010ski. @clawson1957federal, p. 341; @rothman1998tourism, pp. 23-25.]




### NOTES

(147) "massive military expenditures have spurred a major spatial shift in manufacturing production to the so-called defense perimeter. In this manner, the federal government, by means of its military budget and locational preferences, has promoted uneven regional development."

(147) "At the center of these processes of economic structuring and spatial shifts is the information sector, which includes both information technologies (the hardware part) and the use of advanced information systems (the software part). The spatial consequences of these information technologies and systems deserve more attention from historians than they have received. Introduction of these new technologies in the manufacturing and service sectors, for example, directly affects where businesses choose to locate -- since it reduces the need for spatial proximity."

(148) Sees Orange County as a leader in these processes -- economic restructuring, militarization of production, spatial transformation, information technologies and systems, internationalization of a regional economy.
--- Olin article (above)

Santa Clara County came to dominate cultural and commercial influence in the United States, becoming what Carl Abbott called the "new centers for American life."
