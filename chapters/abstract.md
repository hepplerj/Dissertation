This dissertation examines the environmental, economic, and cultural conflicts over the development and use of water projects in California's Santa Clara Valley between 1930 and 1990. Concerns over the nation's water resources emerged in the latter half of the twentieth century, particularly in western states like California. Far western states from Arizona to Washington engaged in new water projects that sought to distribute the resource equally among states, in an attempt to meet the demands of farms, urban growth, and industrial development. Competing ideas about water use and access proved increasingly problematic as private and public interests jostled for access to scarce water resources. The competing idea of preservation and sustainability helped give rise to a modern environmental movement, one that increasingly criticized urban and suburban growth, industrial toxics, and sought the preservation of wilderness areas. The two emergent views over nature conflicted over the issue of water resources, particularly regarding new industrial sectors of high technology. The Santa Clara Valley emerged as the cultural powerhouse in high technology, placing California at the center of these conflicts. By the 1980s, growing numbers of critics were denouncing the environmental impact unrestrained growth and computer companies were placing on the Valley's water resources as political battles raged over the environmental, social, and economic impact of high technology. California voters, once happy to give approval to large public water projects, began pushing back. Controversies such as California voters' rejection of the Central Valley Water Project in 1973, the _____, the legal battles with Fairchild Semiconductor regarding groundwater contamination, and the emergence of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition pitted regional demands against new concerns about the environmental and social consequences of commercial development and urban growth. The story here not only tells the story of California water and western water generally, but Americans' changing understanding of nature and environmental costs that accompanies urban and commercial development.
