% The End of the Boom: The Campaigns to Protect Wetlands, Hillsides, and Floodplains


Raymond Dasmann blamed postwar urban sprawl for the "destruction of California":

> Already we have filled the San Francisco Bay basin with housing, industry, airfields, and highways, from the tops of the hills to the edge of the water. The same thing has happened to Los Angeles. In the Central Valley, from the head in the sloughs leading to San Francisco Bay as far east as the Sierra foothills, one housing tract replaces another in a formless mass of suburbs that have been aptly named ‘slurbs.’ If it could end at this it would be bad enough, but reparable. Instead, the process goes on. Housing and industry spread even farther, engulfing farm and forest, marsh and pasture with no end in sight except the dismal one of a gigantic, disorganized metropolis, filling much of the state and depending for its food on distant lands.^[Dasmann, The Destruction of California, p. 19. Quoted in Rome, Bulldozer in the Countryside, p. 139.]
