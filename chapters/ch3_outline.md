# Outline: How Stanford inadvertently helped launch an environmental movement.

1. CA aspirations to be a center of research & development
  -	Initially supported by residents, many of them new and working in the new
  industries
  - Later, concerns that these decisions were being made by an elite
  group without input from the communities; these decisions had enormous impacts
  on economic and environments of their communities.
  -	Industrial development was a perfect opportunity for northern CA to showcase
  its work, and transform Stanford into something more than a regional school.
  -	Stanford also meant to meet demands and interests of the federal government
  and the Cold War
    -	An alliance between government and Stanford meant an economic boom for the
    university and the community. Meant transforming Stanford into something
    greater.
    -	But, the debate came down to: the environmental costs of growth.
2. Middle-class anxieties over clean air, clean water, open space defined
   environmental politics in the mid-1960s.
  -	Rapidly expanding suburbs
  -	Stewart Udall: “We stand today poised on a pinnacle of wealth and power, yet
  we live in a land of vanishing beauty, of increasing ugliness, of shrinking
  open space and of an overall environment that is diminished daily by pollution
  and noise and blight. This, in brief, is the quiet conservation crisis.”
  -	Rachel Carson, Paul Ehrlich
	-	Suburban, smog, sprawl became common in lexicon
	-	Nixon’s laws: Clean Air 1972, Endangered Species 1973
3. Western cities fit into these concerns
	-	Growth brings wealth, but the pace unsettles westerners
  -	Fueling anti-growth politics and quality of life politics. Often led by
  middle-class suburban professionals. (This is certainly the case in SV).
  -	Growth lay at the center of enviro and social problems, according to the
  critics.
4. Reining in sprawl and quality of life
  -	Liberals and conservatives are interested in this; concerns over out of
  control growth and constant enviro disasters.
  -	Enviro groups appear as common concerns, but by the end of the 1960s have
  joined with civil rights, women’s rights, etc., as part of the culture wars
  — a wedge issue that encompassed pollution, open space, consumer goods.
5. Industrial Park history
  - O'Mara argues that the story of Stanford and the Peninsula "provides a vivid
  example of how the concurrent forces of mass suburbanization and the growth of
  the Cold War science complex interacted with each other to map out
  a low-density, decentralized geography of high-tech production." (98)
  - O'Mara particularly interested in how federal policies played out "on the
  ground," and how "local institutions had a significant effect on the
  development and implementation of federal policy." (98)
  - I note the above only because my own arguments are along similar lines, but
  with regard to environmental politics rather than federal policies.
  - Stanford founded for teaching and research from the start; the railroad
  baron Leland and his wife Jane, who established the school as a memorial to
  their son Leland Jr. who died at age fifteen of typhoid fever. The Leland
  Stanford Junior University opened in 1891.
  - From the start, Stanford prized research in science and technology.
  - Stanford's greatest asset however was land. Nearly nine thousand acres of
  prime agricultural land that would later become some of the most valuable real
  estate in the world. On Leland's Palo Alto farm is where the new university
  was established, in the process bestowing the entire land holding to the
  university with the provision that the land could be leased but never sold.
  The university was the largest land holder on the Peninsula, and would own the
  Farm permanently. (O'Mara, 100)
  - The Farm would remain just that for the next sixty years, leased often to
  ranchers and farmers through which the university generated a small profit.
  The landscape in the minds of early Stanford students and residents was
  a rolling countryside, what Ray Lyman Wilbur called a "spirit of open air and
  a sense of freedom and independence which have become the background of the
  Stanford spirit," a retreat away from the turbulent cities, a place where
  students could find quiet contemplation among the foothills and lakes. "Poppy
  fields, rolling green hills, and winding country roads! The 'Old Grad' loves to
  dream of them!" recalled one alum in 1927.^[Wilbur and alum quoted in @omara, 102.]
  - But the natural landscape was already highly planned. Orchards, farms, rural
  campus.
  - Administrators focused on the university's campus and attracting professors
  from the East and Midwest so that, by the 1920s, the university had developed
  a research reputation. But even before World War II and the Cold War science
  complex, Stanford had begun to attach itself to electronics research,
  beginning with developments in new radio technology.
  - The Second World War brought people and money. The Bay Area experienced
  a remarkable surge in people.
  - The spatial distribution of industry followed the postwar trend of
  industrial development. Industry no longer focused around city centers as they
  had in the past. Rather, manufacturing sought cheaper and spacious outlying
  land for the space of parking, loading, and plant expansion. Second,
  industries sought more desirable working environments; city zoning ordinances
  had pushed industries to less desirable parts of cities. Businesses wanted the
  same amenities as suburban residents: environment, separation from undesirable
  neighborhoods, distance from urban problems, and lower taxes while remaining
  within proximity of city services and amenities.^[@findlay, 120.]. 
  - Stanford Industrial Park opened in 1951 as a light manufacturing district, but
  soon became more closely associated with high technology research and
  development.
  - Stanford entered the land development game in order to improve its
  reputation and attract new talent.
6. In CA, growth brought prosperity. But intense debates formed around growth in
   foothills, routes of freeways.
  - In response to these issues, coalitions emerged such as Committee for Green
  Foothills in opposition to proposed development. Their attempts fail, but
  changes the nature of enviro politics in SV.
  -	Stanford’s desire to be a leader in the West transformed the once-rural towns
  into bustling metropolitan areas.
  -	The fight over the foothills brought disparate groups together into a
  broader political coalition.
    -	Rural residents; urban residents; minorities
	  -	CCRP
	  -	Begin campaigns to rally other community members.
7. Despite opposition, efforts to develop continued throughout the 1960s.
	-	Stanford officials fought back, making the case in newspapers, through letters.
8. Concerned over property, open space, and long-term enviro impacts regarding
   infrastructure, as well as anger at Stanford’s seemingly cavalier responses
   to their concerns, Los Altos Hills and Palo Alto residents organized the CCRP
   in order to fight the selection of their community as an extension of the
   Industrial Park.
9. Other organizations form in response to the foothills
	-	Committee for Green Foothills
	  -	Born in the living room of Ruth Spangenberg
	  -	Mostly made up of Stanford faculty and neighbors of the Industrial Park
    -	Among the twenty-six founding members: Lois and George Hogle, Martin
    Litton, Jack and Eleanor Fowle, and Morgan and Katy Stedman. Wallace Stegner
    became president.
      -	Stegner’s views → how it relates to the organization’s
      general goals
	-	United Palo Altans
