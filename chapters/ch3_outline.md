# Outline: How Stanford inadvertently helped launch an environmental movement.

1. CA aspirations to be a center of research & development
  -	Initially supported by residents, many of them new and working in the new industries
  - Later, concerns that these decisions were being made by an elite group without input from the communities; these decisions had enormous impacts on economic and environments of their communities.
  -	Industrial development was a perfect opportunity for northern CA to showcase its work, and transform Stanford into something more than a regional school.
  -	Stanford also meant to meet demands and interests of the federal government and the Cold War
    -	An alliance between government and Stanford meant an economic boom for the university and the community. Meant transforming Stanford into something greater.
    -	But, the debate came down to: the environmental costs of growth.
2. Middle-class anxieties over clean air, clean water, open space defined environmental politics in the mid-1960s.
  -	Rapidly expanding suburbs
  -	Stewart Udall: “We stand today poised on a pinnacle of wealth and power, yet we live in a land of vanishing beauty, of increasing ugliness, of shrinking open space and of an overall environment that is diminished daily by pollution and noise and blight. This, in brief, is the quiet conservation crisis.”
  -	Rachel Carson, Paul Ehrlich
	-	Suburban, smog, sprawl became common in lexicon
	-	Nixon’s laws: Clean Air 1972, Endangered Species 1973
3. Western cities fit into these concerns
	- Growth brings wealth, but the pace unsettles westerners
	- Fueling anti-growth politics and quality of life politics. Often led by middle-class suburban professionals. (This is certainly the case in SV).
	- Growth lay at the center of enviro and social problems, according to the critics.
4. Reining in sprawl and quality of life
  -	Liberals and conservatives are interested in this; concerns over out of control growth and constant enviro disasters.
  -	Enviro groups appear as common concerns, but by the end of the 1960s have joined with civil rights, women’s rights, etc., as part of the culture wars
  — a wedge issue that encompassed pollution, open space, consumer goods.
5. Industrial Park history
  - O'Mara argues that the story of Stanford and the Peninsula "provides a vivid example of how the concurrent forces of mass suburbanization and the growth of the Cold War science complex interacted with each other to map out a low-density, decentralized geography of high-tech production." (98)
  - O'Mara particularly interested in how federal policies played out "on the ground," and how "local institutions had a significant effect on the development and implementation of federal policy." (98)
  - I note the above only because my own arguments are along similar lines, but with regard to environmental politics rather than federal policies.
  - Stanford founded for teaching and research from the start; the railroad baron Leland and his wife Jane, who established the school as a memorial to their son Leland Jr. who died at age fifteen of typhoid fever. The Leland Stanford Junior University opened in 1891.
  - From the start, Stanford prized research in science and technology.
  - Stanford's greatest asset however was land. Nearly nine thousand acres of prime agricultural land that would later become some of the most valuable real estate in the world. On Leland's Palo Alto farm is where the new university was established, in the process bestowing the entire land holding to the university with the provision that the land could be leased but never sold.  The university was the largest land holder on the Peninsula, and would own the Farm permanently. (O'Mara, 100)
  - The Farm would remain just that for the next sixty years, leased often to ranchers and farmers through which the university generated a small profit.  The landscape in the minds of early Stanford students and residents was a rolling countryside, what University President Ray Lyman Wilbur called a "spirit of open air and a sense of freedom and independence which have become the background of the Stanford spirit," a retreat away from the turbulent cities, a place where students could find quiet contemplation among the foothills and lakes. "Poppy fields, rolling green hills, and winding country roads! The 'Old Grad' loves to dream of them!" recalled one alum in 1927.^[Wilbur and alum quoted in @omara2005cities, 102.]
  - But the natural landscape was already highly planned. Orchards, farms, rural campus.
  - Administrators focused on the university's campus and attracting professors from the East and Midwest so that, by the 1920s, the university had developed a research reputation. But even before World War II and the Cold War science complex, Stanford had begun to attach itself to electronics research, beginning with developments in new radio technology.
  - The Second World War brought people and money. The Bay Area experienced a remarkable surge in people.
  - The spatial distribution of industry followed the postwar trend of industrial development. Industry no longer focused around city centers as they had in the past. Rather, manufacturing sought cheaper and spacious outlying land for the space of parking, loading, and plant expansion. Second, industries sought more desirable working environments; city zoning ordinances had pushed industries to less desirable parts of cities. Businesses wanted the same amenities as suburban residents: environment, separation from undesirable neighborhoods, distance from urban problems, and lower taxes while remaining within proximity of city services and amenities.^[@findlay1991cityscapes, 120.].
  - Stanford Industrial Park opened in 1951 as a light manufacturing district, but soon became more closely associated with high technology research and development.
  - Stanford entered the land development game in order to improve its reputation and attract new talent. Stanford developed a reputation with microwave technology, then aeronautical engineering, and solid-state electronics.
  - In 1945 the university established a planning office and two years later tasked Lewis Mumford to give advice on moving forward. Mumford suggested that Stanford keep an urban core but maintain the "rural setting" and urged that the university should resist the "tendency toward scattering and suburban isolation." Mumford's advise was not heeded. Rents paid by agricultural leasees hardly covered the cost of property taxes, and the suburbanization of the surrounding lands added additional pressure to the drive to develop. Furthermore, state law called for the "highest and best use" of the land, which it used for its assessment for taxes. The university needed income to support its growing educational and research endeavors and needed to prove it did everything in its power to raise the money. The Industrial Park proved too lucrative.
  - The impetuous for development was driven by the incoming university president J. E. Wallace Sterling, who assumed office in 1949. Sterling and Frederick Terman, the Dean of Engineering, and Colbert Coldwell led the drive for Stanford's development of its lands for nonacademic use. On the fringes of the land, they began leasing for a shopping center, residential development, and manufacturing tract. Selecting the southeast corner of the property because of its proximity to a railroad and could be hidden from the main campus by planting trees, the section was selected for light industrial development. 
  - In 1953 the university hired the San Francisco office of Skidmore, Owings, and Merrill to develop a master plan for the Stanford lands.  The university ignored the firm's advice, rejecting the firm's advice to raise money through residential development and suburban development. Terman wanted "a community of technical scholars," and the acreage for residential tracts shrank dramatically. In 1956, the acreage devoted to industry had doubled, and by 1960 industrial uses occupied the Stanford lands more than any other function save the campus. 
  - Despite Stanford's outward claims of following master plans and working with surrounding communities, the university never followed a long-term plan. It considered projects on merit rather than considered planning and land use policies. The only theme of the new industrial park was high technology.
6. In CA, growth brought prosperity. But intense debates formed around growth in foothills, routes of freeways.
  - In response to these issues, coalitions emerged such as Committee for Green Foothills in opposition to proposed development. Their attempts fail, but changes the nature of enviro politics in SV.
  -	Stanford’s desire to be a leader in the West transformed the once-rural towns into bustling metropolitan areas.
  -	The fight over the foothills brought disparate groups together into a broader political coalition.
    -	Rural residents; urban residents; minorities
	  -	CCRP
	  -	Begin campaigns to rally other community members.
7. Despite opposition, efforts to develop continued throughout the 1960s.  -	Stanford officials fought back, making the case in newspapers, through letters.
	- Thomas Ford: "The nicest thing for all of us would be to keep the Stanford hills the way they are today, but the university's need for funds makes that impossible." ^["Foothill industry can be beautiful," Palo Alto Times, March 2, 1960.]
	- Ford makes the case that Stanford works with local governments, and that industrial hills "will be a thing of beauty." Regulations controlling buildings can only cover 20% of the campus, architectual designs that are controlled by Stanford. ^["Foothill industry can be beautiful," Palo Alto Times, March 2, 1960.]
	- An editorial of the PA Times notes that Stanford has a "leading role in determining the development of our communities" because of its large amounts of undeveloped land. The Times argues that the factors of Junipero Serra Boulevard, the rising cost of land, and the pressures of industry have changed the thinking about the foothills development. The Times makes the case for "clean" industry as well, noting that businesses like *Sunset* seek to build offices in the area. "We would find it difficult to find many objects to Sunset as a neighbor." The editorial concludes: "We just have to realize that the inevitable changes are upon us, and while we can't hold them back, we should try to guide them into channels which will be best for the entire area. . . . [the foothills] should not be laid bare, nor should they be leveled. To protect the land and the people in the surrounding areas there is a desperate need for cooperation and planning."^["Crucial decisions facing us now," Palo Alto Times, March 2, 1960.] 
	- Brandin: "We're not in the land development business per se -- we're in the business of education. But we're doing everything we possibly can to produce income [to support education]."^["Undeveloped acres prime resource," Palo Alto Times, March 2, 1960.]

8. Concerned over property, open space, and long-term enviro impacts regarding infrastructure, as well as anger at Stanford’s seemingly cavalier responses to their concerns, Los Altos Hills and Palo Alto residents organized the CCRP in order to fight the selection of their community as an extension of the Industrial Park.
9. Other organizations form in response to the foothills
	-	Committee for Green Foothills
	  -	Born in the living room of Ruth Spangenberg
	  -	Mostly made up of Stanford faculty and neighbors of the Industrial Park
    -	Among the twenty-six founding members: Lois and George Hogle, Martin Litton, Jack and Eleanor Fowle, and Morgan and Katy Stedman. Wallace Stegner became president.
      -	Stegner’s views → how it relates to the organization’s general goals
	-	United Palo Altans
