% Conclusion

> If America is the land were the world goes in search of miracles and redemption, California is the land where Americans go. It is America’s America, the symbol of raw hope and brave (even foolish) invention, where ancient traditions and inhibitions are abandoned at the border. Its peculiar culture squirts out — on film and menus and pages and television beams — the trends and tastes that sweep the rest of the country.

In the late 1970s, a local radio station took to announcing that it was broadcasting
st
from “Silicon Valley, World Headquarters of the 21 Century.” Echoing Walter
Benjamin’s famous description of Paris as the “Capital of the Nineteenth Century,” the
appellation signaled Valley resident’s late-twentieth century sense that they were the
architects of a new economic and cultural sensibility; that they had invented new ways of
consuming and communicating; that here they had birthed a new form of capitalism,
which would spread to the rest of the country. Yet not all residents were sanguine about
that prospect. In 1980, one local said to a journalist that there were problems in paradise.
“If this area has that much influence on our ideologies and our philosophies and our way
16 of life, God help us.” (Haynes Johnson, “The Perils of Paradise,” Washington Post, October 19, 1980.)
