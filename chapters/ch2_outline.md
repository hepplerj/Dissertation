Joe Ruscigno, a lifetime farmer and resident of San Jose, started a new occupation in 1952. "Guess I've pulled out 150 acres of trees since the first of the year," he told the San Francisco Chronicle. Ruscigno lamented the uprooting of the prune trees to the bulldozer he now sat upon, but "what can you do? . . . The subdivisions were coming in all around us and when they made a good offer I sold out."[1] Chapter 3 builds chronologically from the previous chapters and extends the story into the postwar years. The chapter will focus primarily on urban growth between 1945 and 1965, and examine how new residents attempted to exert changes upon water resources in order to support the growing cities. To keep the story focused, the chapter will use the city of San Jose as a case study. San Jose exemplified changes occurring in other Peninsula cities and will examine urban growth and its encroachment upon natural water features and new demands on municipal water supplies. 

Central question: How does San Jose and the county, seen as symbols of wise planning and applauded for aggressive urban growth in the 1950s, gain its reputation as a suburban disaster. Many of the debates begin to revolve around issues of the environment: traffic, pollution, sewage, water access.

1.	Introduction
2.	Suburban governments proliferate in municipal incorporations between 1952 and 1957
	⁃	During this time, seven new cities incorporate in Santa Clara County — almost doubling the number of municipalities in the county.
	⁃	“Growth controls” put in place to control the development of the municipalities, often focused on residential development
	⁃	Not until the 1970s are growth controls a topic of serious political debate (see Chapter 4)
	⁃	Regulations provided structure to a suburban area — and gave amenities: low taxes, excluding problems of poverty, urban. 
	⁃	Prop 14?
3.THESIS: Growth oriented bureaucrats in San Jose used planning to expand the city; this was then embraced by grassroots suburban activists in the 1960s to stop growth. [My argument]
	⁃	Historians have debated these issues
	⁃	Mike Davis, for example, sees growth control not as a concern over the environment, but instead a protection of property values. Davis: “How conservative homeowners in the age of Reagan came to advocate a structural reform implying massive regulation of one of the most sacred marketplaces (land development) is a story that has certain fascinations.”[2]
	⁃	Others, like Adam Rome, challenge this view, and identify growth control as a genuine environmental reaction to suburbanization. What seemed to be progress in 1945 — bulldozed landscapes — became destruction by the 1970s.[3] Peter Siskind notes that growth controls “at once emerged from and sought to recast post-New Deal growth liberalism; their politics cannot be confined in the simple categories of backlash, anti statism, or conservatism that dominate our understanding of suburban politics.”[4] Liberalism, according to Lily Geismer, jettisoned its postwar drive for growth and focused on quality of life — anti-sprawl, slow-growth mentality that preserved open space.[5]
4.	Debates over growth controls were about preserving views.
	⁃	Aesthetic views were originally more important than environmental concerns
5.	Reactions to sprawl
	⁃	Contextualized with the wider environmental movement critique
