Stanford Industrial Park opened its doors in 1951. Carved out in the southeast
corner of Stanford's vast land holdings on the San Francisco Peninsula, the
industrial park marked the emergence of the university's drive to suburbanize
its campus, determine nonacademic uses for its lands, and forge close links to
government and industry. Scientific funding by the federal government alone was
rising rapidly in the 1950s. In 1955, federal expenditures on basic research
topped $286 million, a figure that jumped to $693 million by 1960 and, just five
years later, topped $1.6 *billion*. The total research and development budget of
the federal government had grown from 8 percent to twelve percent in just ten
years.^[@omara2005cities, 47.] Stanford Industrial Park was the most outwardly
facing result of university drives to enter new markets.

## Aspirations for Stanford

World War II and the location of defense industries along the West Coast drew
thousands of new residents to California in search of jobs after decades of
economic depression.^[On the great migration to California, see the book on
Okies, etc.] Between 1940 and 1947, the nine counties of the Bay Area became
home for 676,000 more people, 330,000 new jobs, and $2.5 billion more in annual
income.^[@omara2005cities, 103.] The Cold War science complex, anchored by the
Stanford Industrial Park, added an additional influx of people and capital to
the region. The region's population more than doubled by 1960.^[U.S. Bureau of
the Census, 1960 Census, Santa Clara County, n.d., census.abag.ca.gov; U.S.
Bureau of the Census, 1970 Census, Santa Clara County, n.d., census.abag.ca.gov;
U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1980 Census, Santa Clara County, n.d.,
census.abag.ca.gov.] In 1950, Santa Clara County alone counted 800 factory
workers, which jumped to 264,000 manufacturing workers and more than 3,000
electronics firms by 1980.^[@abbott2008cities, 181.]

Industrialization drove the new influx of residents. Along the Peninsula, cities
sought out new ways to attract industries to the area in order to capitalize on
new economic growth. Bay Area governmental associations, including the Bay Area
Council (BAC), sought to make California an industrial center not by replicating
the industrial Northeast or Midwest but by promoting new
industries.^[@omara2005cities, 106.] 

Anxieties over suburban growth and issues of clean air and water, open space,
sprawl, and pollution defined environmental politics against its preservationist
history. Postwar environmentalism largely became issues over quality-of-life as
new worries about chemicals used in products, pollution of water resources,
pesticides, and overrun national parks became key political issues. The
publication of bestselling books, including Stewart Udall's *The Quiet Crisis*,
Rachel Carson's *The Silent Spring*, and Paul Ehrlich's *The Population Bomb*,
made the case for greater regulation of growth and pollution. The passage of new
legislation embodied new attempts to protect land, air, and water, such as the
Wilderness Act of 1964, the National Environmental Policy Act of 1970, the
creation of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Clean Air Act of 1972, and
Endangered Species Act of 1973.

Against this backdrop, rapid growth in western cities encouraged new concerns
about their environmental impact, which had the effect of changing local and
regional politics. World War II defense industries, Cold War military and
industrial buildup, and tourism and recreation encouraged the growth of western
cities, and, while growth brought new prosperity and wealth, it also unsettled
westerners who watched rural landscapes vanish under four-lane highways, parking
lots, office buildings, and residential developments. By the 1960s, some
westerners began pushing back against the tide of change and fueled new
antigrowth and environmental politics throughout the region. Comprised mostly of
middle-class professionals, suburban liberals and conservatives found common
ground over environmental damage, uncontrolled growth, poor planning and
development, trampled wilderness, and disappearing open
space.^[@childers2010ski, 70-72.]

Quality-of-life and antigrowth activists argued that uncontrolled growth lay at
the center of the West's social and environmental problems. Air pollution, loss
of open space, damaged wilderness areas, industrialization, and urban sprawl
threatened the very qualities that led millions of Americans to move West after
World War II. The region's vast public lands, economic opportunities, and clean
air, activists argued, were under threat by the continuous growth characterizing
western metropolitan areas. By the 1970s, westerners began arguing for limits on
growth in order to protect their quality of life.^[@childers2010ski, 72.]

## Industrial Parks in the United States

Stanford Industrial Park emerged amid changes in postwar industrial
architecture.^[The best accounts of Stanford Industrial Park's planning and
development are in @omara2005cities and @findlay1993magic.] Thirty-three
industrial parks existed in the United States in 1940, quickly rising to 307 by
1957. The increase in industrial parks coincided with them becoming less likely
to locate within cities, leading to 75 percent of parks built after World War II
being located in areas whose populations were between 25,000 and 500,000 people.
By the 1950s, parks were locating outside of city centers and instead found
homes in suburbs, allowing firms in the parks to take advantage of a nearby
workforce, new tax benefits, avoiding traffic congestion, bypassing old
infrastructure, and locating out of reach from unions in older industrial
cities. Although many firms remained in city centers to take advantage of
certain benefits -- proximity to services such as public transportation -- many
located themselves in suburban areas.^[1957 Dept of Commerce report;
@omara2005cities, 66.] The suburbanization of industry led land developers to
adhere to higher standards in urban design. The real estate consultancy Arthur
D. Little, Inc., noted in 1958 that industrial parks were organized according to
"a comprehensive plan" designed to "insure compatibility between the industrial
operations therein and the existing activities and character of the community in
which the park is located." These parks were designed according to "proper
setbacks, lot size minimums, land/use ratio minimums, architectural provisions,
landscaping requirements, and specific use requirements" in order to maintain
a "harmonious integration into the neighborhood."^[Quoted in @omara2005cities,
65.] The principles of open spaces, architectural uniformity, and land use
restrictions shaped the spatial influence parks had on suburban areas.

Affluent suburbanites were willing to take advantage of new tax revenues and job
opportunities present in new industries, but were unwilling to accommodate those
industries if they had an affect on their quality of life. Smokestacks, traffic
congestion, and air or noise pollution would not be tolerated, and new
industries were quick to point out that their brand of industrialization would
not carry such blemishes on the landscape. A 1958 pamphlet from the Palo Alto
Chamber of Commerce noted that, just a few years after the opening of the
Stanford Industrial Park, the city was "a well planned community with
a favorable atmosphere for light industry"^["Light Industry in the Palo Alto
Area," 1958, Folder 5 Palo Alto History, Box 5 ARCH-1990-052, Stanford
University Land Use Planning Office, SUA, p. 1.]

Industry had another reason to locate near suburban areas: to strengthen its
ties to research institutions. <!-- expand -->

## "The Miracle of Palo Alto"

The railroad baron and businessman Leland Stanford and his wife, Jane, founded
the university in 1891 in the memory of their son Leland Stanford, Jr., who died
at age fifteen from typhoid fever. The Leland Stanford Junior University was
established on Leland's vast farmland -- nearly nine thousand acres of prime
agricultural land -- and bestowed all of the land to the university, which could
lease the land however it saw fit but could never sell it. The university was
the largest land holder on the Peninsula, and would own the Farm permanently.
For sixty years after the university's founding, the Farm would remain just that
before becoming some of the most valuable land in the country.  Most of the land
was leased to farmers and ranchers and the rolling foothills would largely
remain undeveloped until mid-century.^[@omara2005cities, 102; @findlay1993magic,
120.]

The Second World War and the Cold War introduced a surge in the population of
the Bay Area.  The towns around Stanford grew rapidly during and after World War
II as middle-class families moved to the area to take advantage of new defense
and related industries. Menlo Park grew from a town of 3,000 to 27,000 between
1940 and 1960, while Palo Alto grew from under 17,000 to 52,000 in the same
period. To Stanford's chagrin, however, most commercial activity located
elsewhere on the Peninsula. The majority of commercial development around
Stanford were retail and services.^[@omara2005cities, 107.] If Stanford was to
become the center of a new western economy, they needed  to pursue new industries. They
found those industries from technology firms that started in the area, including
Hewlett-Packard and Varian Associates. Regional electronics manufacturing grew
quickly. The Western Electronics Manufacturers Association listed twenty members
in the Bay Area in 1951; by 1953 it counted fifty-three, and by 1974 listed
eight-hundred and employed around 150,000 people.^[@findlay1993magic, 145.] The
bulk of new manufacturers created products for the Department of Defense and
NASA. Between 1952 and 1968, electronics firms made at least half of their
annual incomes from sales to the federal government for military and space
programs. Desires on the part of NASA and the Pentagon for compact systems of
missile and rocket guidance as well as wars in Korea and Vietnam and the space
race, electronics equipment accounted for as much as twenty percent of the cost
of an aircraft and thirty percent of the cost for missiles. While southern
California focused on building the aircrafts, northern California provided the
electrical components.^[Blue Heaven book; @findlay1993magic, 143-144; Albert
Shapero, Richard P. Howell, and James R. Tombough, *An Exploratory Study of the
Structure and Dynamics of the R&D Industry* (Menlo Park, Calif., 1964), 23-25;

The spatial distribution of industry followed a postwar trend in industrial
design and development. Industry no longer developed in central cities as it
historically had. Rather, industrial manufacturing sought cheaper and more
spacious outlying lands that had adequate space for parking, loading facilities,
and room for plant expansions. Industries also sought more amenable work
environments. City ordinances in the latter half of the twentieth century began
pushing industry to less desirable areas of cities, while industrial facilities
sought the same amenities as suburbanites: a pleasant environment, suburban
neighborhoods, distance from urban problems, and lower taxes, while remaining in
proximity of city services and infrastructure.^[@findlay1993magic, 120.]

Stanford never ran short of potential tenants attracted to the suburban design
of the park and its proximity to the university. The university privileged those
companies working in high technology and medicine -- and thus contributed to
Stanford's educational and research programs -- and welcomed several companies
to the park, including Eastman Kodack, Varian Associations, Hewlett-Packard,
Syntex Pharmaceutical, and Lockheed Missiles. The park grew quickly as its
reputation spread. In 1955, only seven tenants occupied fifty-three acres of the
industrial park. By 1962 the number had jumped to forty-two tenants occupying
360 acres (around half of the available space) and employed 11,000 people. By
1970, the number of tenants had reached fifty, occupied 500 acres, and employed
17,000 people. The rents generated tremendous profits for the university, by
1978 reaching an annual profit of $4.3 million, while also generating another
$13.5 million in tax revenue and utility payments for the city of Palo
Alto.^[City of Palo Alto, Calif., *Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan, 1977-1990*
(Palo Alto, 1976), 15; @findlay1993magic, 140.]

The development of Stanford Industrial Park marked the emergence of the modern
West: a region less reliant on what economist Thomas Michael Power called "folk
economics" <!-- define this -->  and more reliant on postindustrial economies of
tourism and technology.^[@power1996landscapes, 19-21. <!-- WHAT ELSE ON
TOURISM?-->] The economic shift meant a cultural shift as well. As farmland,
pastures, and ranches became subdivisions, technology companies, research firms,
and service industries, the new economic activity began to reshape how people
thought about the Valley.  Namely, the expansion of industry carried with it
a contentious debate about the effects of industrialization on the Valley's
landscape and a debate over how it would be shaped.^[On postwar suburban growth,
see @jackson1985crabgrass; @fishman1987bourgeois, 155–81; @abbott1995frontier;
@duany2001suburban; @nicolaides2002heavan; @gutfreund2004sprawl.] By the late
1950s residents in Palo Alto began seeing the industrial park as a threat to
their suburban lifestyles, especially visible through increased traffic,
industrial development of the foothills, contributions to air and noise
pollution, and rising housing costs. In 1960, these concerns boiled over and,
inadvertently, helped launch an environmental movement on the Mid-Peninsula.

<!-- IDEA: Lets de-emphasize Terman; he's cited everywhere, by O'Mara, Findley,
the celebratory works. The real work of building the Valley came from Terman,
Alf Brandin, the Board of Trustees, and Colbert Coldwell (real estate 
advisor). The story of Terman's centrality seems to come from historical 
sources that give him credit. Not to undermine Terman, but that the process 
was more complicated than just Terman.

## Stanford University, Suburban Environmentalism, and the Battle of the Hills

<!--
STANFORD IS A SYMPTOM OF A LARGER ISSUE?
- Problems of regional planning
- Urban sprawl
- The need for local and federal action to conserve land/water
- Thus, organizations like California Tomorrow don't necessarily emerge as
a direct result of Stanford (unlike Committee for Green Foothills) but they are
part of a larger conversation happening in the Bay Area about growth and
planning.

REMEMBER: competing ideas of a hybrid landscape: built for industry vs. built for nature
-->

Widespread concerns over the environmental impact of the West's rapid growth and
new industrial economies shaped regional and local politics. The economic and
infrastructural changes wrought by World War II, the militarization of western
industry, and the growing recreational and tourism economy led to breakneck
metropolitan growth throughout the region between 1940 and 1960. Westerners
witnessed diminishing rural lands, growing suburbs, and four-lane highways,
giving rise to a cultural and political backlash throughout the region that
manifested itself in antigrowth activism and quality-of-life politics. Largely
comprised of middle-class professionals, metropolitan growth and environmental
and social problems identified by growth and quality-of-life activists lay at
the center of their motivations. The millions of Americans coming to western
states like Colorado, Oregon, and California since World War II came to take
advantage of these state's air quality, federal public lands, recreation, and
economic opportunities. By the 1960s, however, newcomers and old-timers alike
believed too many people were moving in and threatening their quality of
life.^[On quality-of-life politics, see @abbott2008cities, 205;
@carney2007suburbanizing: 480-481; @scott2008hip, 253--255; @childers2010ski,
71-73.]

In California, rapid growth brought prosperity to the state, but by the 1960s
Californians were questioning these benefits. In 1960, a short but intense fight
over the proposed industrial development of the Stanford foothills to the
southeast of the main campus marked the beginning of a cultural and political
shift in the Bay Area. Stanford announced in January plans to expand foothills
development southward from the existing Industrial Park. In particular, Stanford
received interest in industrial construction from the Ampex Corporation,
a manufacturer of high-end sound recording and broadcasting electronics, to
build a new research facility in the foothills. Surrounding neighborhoods,
however, fiercely opposed the development on Stanford's property, leading to
a referendum campaign that Stanford President Wallace Sterling referred to as
"the Battle of the Hills."^[Margaret O'Mara provides an excellent account of the
Battle of the Hills in Cities of Knowledge. O'Mara argues for the importance of
this event towards understanding how Stanford understood itself as an urban
planner rather than community concerns that arose from environmental issues. See
@omara2005cities, 135-139.]

In 1960, roughly six-hundred acres of undeveloped university land lay between 
Junipero Serra, West Fremont, Arastradero, and Page Mill Roads. Originally 
zoned for residential development, Stanford administrators decided to rezone 
the land as light industry without consulting or seeking approval from the 
county or surrounding neighborhoods. To rezone the land, procedure dictated 
that Stanford offer the land to Palo Alto for annexation. The Palo Alto city 
council and planning commission, then, had the authority to rezone the land. 
The process meant the land would remain controlled by Stanford policies, taxes 
collected by the city, and the land could be leased to industrial 
developers.^["Decision now will determine future," *Palo Alto Times*, February 
11, 1960, 16.]

<!-- get a better figure-->

![Map of the proposed foothills development. *Palo Alto Times*, March 18, 1960.](figures/map_foothills.png)

Electronics manufacturers had already sought out the area as prime real estate
for establishing research facilities, taking advantage of nearby residential
neighborhoods for employees to live, proximity to researchers at Stanford and
the Industrial Park, established city infrastructure, and a favorable tax
climate. In early 1960, Ampex and General Telephone and Electronics Laboratories
Corporation (GT&E) announced plans to build or expand their operations in the
Stanford foothills both north and south along Page Mill Road, in part to take
advantage of the proposed route of the Junipero Serra Freeway.^["Ampex plant
just first in Stanford plan," *Palo Alto Times*, January 14, 1960, 2;
"Electronics research plant planned for foothills area," *Palo Alto Times*,
January 28, 1960, 1; letter from Wallace Sterling to Gordon Johnson, March 16,
1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA.] Additional development plans were laid out for
a new shopping center and luxury homes development in the Palo Alto-Los Altos
Hills foothills.^["103 are foothill plan told," *Palo Alto Times*, January 29,
1960, 1-2.]

Residents had few objections for the proposed residential and shopping center
development in the foothills; the ire of residents turned to Ampex and
industrialization.  Ampex's proposed eighty-acre development location ran up
against resistance from neighboring communities, fueling quality-of-life and
environmental politics in surrounding neighborhoods. The proposed site ran along
the Los Altos Hills city line and raised concerns among property owners and Los
Altos Hills city officials, who feared the loss of scenic beauty and the
residential ambiance of the area.^["Decision now will determine future," *Palo
Alto Times*, February 11, 1960, 16.] Furthermore, residents were growing
suspicious of Stanford's role as a land developer. One resident summed up the
issue saying, "there has been growing concern over Stanford's policy of
presenting pre-packaged zoning requests. . . . They resemble closely the tactics
of many a Land Developer asking for variances from planned uses."^[Morgan
Stedman, text of prepared meeting with Sterling, March 14, 1960, FF11, Box A29,
SC 216, SUA. Quoted in O'Mara, *Cities of Knowledge*, 136.] Another resident
wrote the Stanford Trustees urging the foothills to remain closed to industrial
development: "The Peninsula is already too crowded -- therefore, new industry
should not locate here."^[Letter from Mrs. H. Wilson to Stanford Trustees, March
4, 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA.] Palo Alto resident Richard Bell in a letter
to Sterling lamented the "program of land exploitation pursued by the school
during the past ten years" which has "succeeded . . . in eliminating much of the
natural beauty and attraction . . . [that] contributed so much toward making
Stanford the top school in the west."^[Letter from Richard Bell to Wallace
Sterling, August 2, 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA.]

Complaints of potential industrialization of the foothills reflected not only 
arguments about the area's beauty, but also the noise and air pollution that 
accompanied development. The sounds of hammers driving nails into two-by-fours 
was only part of a chorus of common sounds experienced by suburbanites. The 
whirring and grinding of manufacturing equipment, the clattering of dump 
trucks, the drone of automobile traffic, the belching of bulldozers -- these 
became common sounds of the city. Concerned that such realities would become 
even more common in Palo Alto, critics spoke up. In a letter to the *Palo Alto 
Times*, Morgan Stedman, a member of the Santa Clara County Planning 
Commission, argued that new foothills industrialization would increase traffic 
flow through neighborhoods, thus increasing smog, noise, and danger, 
large-scale cutting and filling of land would be required to support new 
buildings, parking lots, and roads, the loss of rainwater through runoff, and 
"irreparable damage to natural beauty."^[Newspaper clipping, "Area planning 
seen as needed," Palo Alto Times, March 12, 1960, from FF8, Box A29, SC 216, 
SUA.] Other residents expressed concern over tests being run on their shrubs 
to see if radiation levels were becoming too high.

The spatial arrangements of cities and zoning shaped how residents responded to
the proposed industrialization. The majority of the foothills area were zoned
for residential or agricultural use <!-- {in what planning documents?} -->. But
encroachments of industry into these areas raised concerns about the loss of the
hills and potential hazards that industrialization would bring to surrounding
communities. Stanford's claimed that the industrialization would result in clean
and well-kept facilities. The smoke pollution of the Midwest and East would
never be present in the Valley. However, a greater concern for local residents
revolved around the issue of smog and traffic. The threat of increased traffic,
smog, concerns about the loss of the foothills pastoral beauty, and Stanford's
cavalier handling of community relations resulted in new political energy that
would spread through the community and alumni networks.^[@omara2005cities, 135.]
In a letter to Wallace Sterling, one resident summed up the attitude of many of
the area's environmental critics:

> We now have smog, congestion, and acres of asphalt where we once had fresh air
> and freedom of movement in a beautiful countryside -- in one of the finest
> climates on earth! The responsibility for developing such a unique area should
> be in the hands of the most intelligent and PERCEPTIVE people available! There
> seems to be little concern about total environment. . . . The area sorely
> needs parks, golf courses, and low density housing. We need cultural and
> recreational centers for all age levels. A University such as Stanford could
> well promote an interest in fields that enrich life. Industrial and commercial
> interests are far from being neglected but the humanities certainly
> are!^[Letter from Gordon Johnson to Wallace Sterling, March 6, 1960, FF8, Box
> A29, SC 216, SUA.]

Ad hoc community and  environmental coalitions formed in the wake of 
Stanford's announcement, led by the Citizens Committee on Regional Planning 
(CCRP). The organization, under the initial leadership of Robert Mahan, an 
insurance executive from Palo Alto, organized a letter writing campaign to 
voice their opposition to the foothills plans. Just weeks before the group 
became officially known as CCRP, members printed a copy of a letter in the 
*Palo Alto Times* urging readers to clip the letter from the newspaper and 
mail it to the Stanford Board of Trustees to illustrate grassroots opposition 
to industrialization.^["Anti-foothill industry drive launched here," Palo Alto 
Times, March 8, 1960, 2; "Industry opponents organize, name head," Palo Alto 
Times, March 11, 1960, 1.] <!-- {What does this letter say?  What's the 
argument? Examples? Find this.} --> Within two days of publishing the letter, 
the Stanford Board of Trustees had received 250 letters voicing opposition to 
the plan; many of the letters were clipped from the CCRP's *Palo Alto Times* 
letter.^["Industry opponents organize," *Palo Alto Times*, March 11, 1960, 1; 
"13 residents protest foothill zoning change," *Palo Alto Times*, March 4, 
1960, 17.] Resistance from residents targeted the city council as well. The 
Palo Alto Residents Association (PARA) called for "a vigorous campaign" 
against the Palo Alto City Council's plans to allow industrial development in 
the foothills.^["Residents oppose industry," *Palo Alto Times*, March 10, 
1960, 1.  Residents also pointed to a potential conflict of interest 
relationship between Palo Alto Mayor Noel Porter and David Packard. Porter was 
serving as vice president of Hewlett-Packard at the time. See "Industry 
opponents organize, name head," *Palo Alto Times*, March 11, 1960.] Resistance 
stemmed from the potential for degrading the landscape. Peter Hughes, an 
officer of PARA, charged that developing the foothills would destroy the 
landscape. Calculating that the Ampex site would cover thirty acres of parking 
lot and another twelve acres for buildings, Hughes challenged that "if anyone 
can lay down that amount of building without changing the contour of the land 
he is an engineer the like of which I have never seen."^["Residents oppose 
industry," *Palo Alto Times*, March 10, 1960, 1.]

The neighboring community of Los Altos Hills also expressed their disapproval 
of the plans. Residents, irate that their residential-only incorporation would 
be besmirched by industrialized foothills, expressed their displeasure 
through letters and newspaper editorials. Mayor John Fowle and city council 
rebuffed Stanford in a letter to Alf Brandin, accusing Stanford of 
"jeopardizing existing zoning and land development" and charged that the 
university's plans were never "subject to public scrutiny." Furthermore, 
contrary to Stanford's claims that it was working with surrounding 
communities, Los Altos Hills claimed it was caught unaware of the university's 
plans.^["Stanford foothills plans hit by Hills," *Palo Alto Times*, February 
10, 1960.] 

Letters from residents poured into Stanford. University President Wallace 
Sterling received around 400 letters in opposition to the plan and only fifty 
in support over the course of four months.^[@omara2005cities, 134.] The 
editorial page of the *Palo Alto Times* also became a key outlet for residents 
to voice their frustrations and concerns. Many of the editorials focused on 
WHAT <!--do some text analysis; what's here?-->

For its part, Stanford pushed back by arguing that it needed to develop the 
lands in order to remain profitable. Thomas Ford, staff council for the 
university, claimed that he desired to see the land remain undeveloped but 
"the university's need for funds makes that impossible."^["Foothills industry 
can be beautiful," *Palo Alto Times*, March 2, 1960.] Stanford had good reason 
to pursue this line of argument. The university had indeed fallen on financial 
hard times, and its endowment was far below what it considered its peer 
institutions. Stanford continued their refrain that the development of the 
foothills would not become an industry blight, but rather, in the words of 
Thomas Ford, would "be a thing of beauty" because of the design regulations 
enforced by Stanford.^["Foothill industry can be beautiful," *Palo Alto 
Times*, March 2, 1960.] Furthermore, Stanford positioned itself as a reluctant 
land developer only in the business of supporting education and research. Alf 
Brandin explained to the *Palo Alto Times* that the university was not "in the 
land development business per se" but that the university was "doing 
everything we possibly can to produce income [to support 
education]."^["Undeveloped acres prime resource," *Palo Alto Times*, March 4, 
1960.] "People should feel thankful Stanford owns the land and not someone 
else," Brandin chided. "We try to look at the problems politically, 
sociologically, aesthetically, and economically."^["Stanford wouldn't do 
anything detrimental," *Palo Alto Times*, March 4, 1960.] Stanford urged 
residents to realize the role the university had played in preserving open 
space, the role residents played in causing traffic congestion, and Stanford's 
road construction efforts. Without Stanford, the university seemed to argue, 
none of these improvements would exist.^["Foothills industry can be 
beautiful," *Palo Alto Times*, March 2, 1960; "Stanford wouldn't do anything 
detrimental," *Palo Alto Times*, March 4, 1960; Letter from Gordon Johnson to 
Wallace Sterling, March 6, 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA.]

A common complaint was the pastoral scenery that would disappear in the face of
industrial buildings.^[Letter from Wallace Sterling to Gordon Johnson, March 6,
1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA.]

When letter and editorial campaigns failed to initiate the planning that
critics wanted to see, they turned to the next available civic tool: the
referendum. In June a petition campaign initiated by opponents of foothills
industrialization circulated through Palo Alto. The petition called on
the city council to either rescind its decision to rezone the land for light industry
or to allow residents a vote on the issue. Four days before the rezoning
ordinance was to become official, the referendum petition was filed to the city
having collected over two-thousand signatures, well above the necessary 1,000 
that was needed. The Stanford lands were now in the hands of the voters. 
Placed on the ballot for the November elections, a "yes" vote would allow for 
Stanford to carry forward with its expansion of the Industrial Park and pave 
the way for Ampex's research facility.^[Details about the petition's 
criticisms and intent can be found in a letter from Morgan Stedman to Wallace 
Sterling, June 20, 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA. In an explanatory sheet 
given to solicitors and signers of the petition, the referendum called for 
better planning of residential, industrial, and commercial areas and 
specifically criticized the sudden zoning change to light manufacturing, 
housing and traffic pressures that new industrialization would add to the 
area, the leveling of hills to accommodate new construction, and pointed to 
undeveloped lots already zoned for industry as alternatives to foothills 
development. Letter from Stedman to Sterling, June 20, 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 
216, SUA.]

As referendum supporters were gathering signatures, additional pressure to
resist land development came from Stanford alumni. In June, a group calling
themselves the Bay Area Stanford Alumni printed an insert in the *Stanford
Review*, the alumni news organ of the university, accusing Stanford of ignoring land
development policies implemented by the Board of Trustees in 1958. The petition
called on Stanford to find alternatives for earning money other than "defacing
the beauty of the green and summertimes golden hills" and called on the
university to consult with the master plans of surrounding communities.^["A
Message from Bay Area Stanford Alumni to President Sterling and the Board of
Trustees," 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA, pp. 2-3.] Preston Burchard, the
spokesman for the group, noted the petition already had 146 signatures before
the insert ran in the *Review*. The *Review* was quick to distance itself from 
the bay Area Stanford Alumni. In the issue in which the insert ran, Kemper 
Freeman, a graduate of Stanford and president of the Stanford Alumni 
Association, noted that the alumni organization "emphatically disagrees with 
the views and impressions" of the insert. Freeman placed distance between the 
alumni association and the Bay Area group, noting that the group's members 
accounted for "less than half of one per cent of the total" number of Stanford 
alumni living in the Bay Area. The *Review* ran the insert, Freeman argued, 
because the periodical "stands for freedom of expression," but "reject[ed] 
their assumptions, criticisms, and conclusions."^[Kemper Freeman to Stanford 
Alumnus, *Stanford Review*, June-July 1960, Folder 8, Box A29, SC 216, Wallace 
Sterling Papers, SUA, p. 1.]

Kemper's letter responded to the insert's criticism point by point, noting 
that the Stanford lands were "never intended to be a wilderness" and concluded 
that the development of lands not "needed for academic purposes is overdue." 
Furthermore, the insert gave "no hint" that Stanford was "preserving 4,800 of 
its 8,800 acres for academic purposes or that this reserve includes the 
greater part of the 'rolling hills.' Nor does it reveal that for every two 
acres of its land which Stanford has leased in the past decade, one acre has 
been condemned for use by some governmental unit or agency." These 
condemnations, Freeman concludes, are a threat.

As the referendum campaign dragged on through the summer, editorials to the
*Times* attempted to flip complaints about the loss of the foothills
upside-down, using the critic's nostalgia of the environment as an argument in
Stanford's favor.  An editorial in the *Palo Alto Times* expressed "gratitude"
to Stanford for "so generously permitting thousands of people to freely enjoy
the rolling, tree-studded hills, the lakes, and views of the campus."^[Esther B.
Clark, M.D., Letter to the Editor, *Palo Alto Times*, March 28, 1960, FF 11, Box
A29, SC 216, SUA.] The *Times* itself continued its enthusiasm for Stanford,
writing that the community owed Stanford a debt for keeping the area's lands
free of intrusive industry.  The *Times* argued that Stanford's large
landholdings "constituted a free park" for Palo Alto and surrounding
communities. Had these lands fallen into the hands of private owners, they "long
ago would have been converted to the houses, business places and industries
where so many of us live and work."^[Editorial, *Palo Alto Times*, November
1960, Stanford Lands Scrapbook V, 1960-61, Subject File 1300/9, SUA.] One
editorial writer to the *Times* admonished the former "solid supporters of free
enterprise" who were now staging "violent public quarrels about what they're
going to do with someone else's property" that "the land isn't theirs" and
Stanford could -- and should -- do what it needs to do.^[Editorial by Daniel S.
Endsley, *Palo Alto TImes*, November 1, 1960.] Stanford itself was quick to
remind critics of the efforts the university had put towards city development.
As Sterling reminded one critic, overseeing the vast domain of land on the
Peninsula meant "the hills are not likely to be overrun by any commercial
developments in your lifetime or mine."^["Letter from Wallace Sterling to Gordon
Johnson," March 6, 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA. Editorials to the *Palo Alto
Times* made the same claims.  See, for example, the editorial by Louise
Brisebat, *Palo Alto Times*, November 4, 1960.] In other cases, they were
willing to dismiss them entirely. Donald Carlson referred to them as
"malcontents in the community" and complained in another letter that
industrialization would only affect "one little foothill," dismissing their 
concerns over something trivial. {CITATION}^[Letter
from Donald Carlson to Ben Allen, May 12, 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA;
"Groups Clash over Use of Stanford Land,"* San Francisco Examiner*, March 18,
1960.]

The referendum was defeated in a close vote, allowing Stanford to pursue its
development plans for the foothills. On the one hand, the campaign against the
Ampex development could be considered a victory. The company, after the
drawn-out political process, elected to build its research facility elsewhere.
On the other hand, the new zoning of the foothills opened the path for new light
industry to join the Stanford Industrial Park. But environmentalists learned
lessons from the campaign. {EXPLAIN}. Stanford learned lessons as well,
reflected in later public battles with communities. Most notably a year later
when Palo Alto considered the expansion of Oregon Avenue into an expressway,
a route that ran through desirable residential land, residents began organizing
resistance. But another community group calling themselves the Traffic Action
Committee emerged to support the expansion. The pro-expressway movement arose
from grassroots, but its support would not remain limited to citizens and, it
appears, Stanford played a role in helping create the group. Stanford supported
the expressway because it would serve as a much-needed traffic artery to the
Park. Donald Carlson noted that "Stanford is a nasty word" and the university
was "not going to suddenly turn on any lights, show the truth and make them love
us." Carlson did not "see much harm in our taking a background role in the
Traffic Action Committee" and provide public support to the mayor and city
council who were "anxious to get the thing turned around somehow and get some of
that bond money applied to the city's traffic problem where it hurts the
most."^[Letter from Donald Carlson to Frederic Glover, September 20, 1961, Box
A22, SUA. See also @omara2005cities, 138-139.]

<!--
Referendum supporters were not without their critics. Donald Carlson referred to
them as "malcontents in the community," and the *San Francisco Examiner*
referred to "wild-eyed claims" of the protesters.^[Letter from Donald Carlson to
Ben Allen, May 12, 1960, FF8, Box A29, SC 216, SUA; "Groups Clash over Use of
Stanford Land,"* San Francisco Examiner*, March 18, 1960.]

Too often, the city of Palo Alto happily yielded to Stanford's wishes.

Stanford administrators felt they understood the debate, or at the least could
not understand why residents were up in arms about Stanford's development plans.
Alf Brandin recalled that Stanford had an issue with semantics, arguing that "we
tried to say it has got to be clean, no smoke, no heavy manufacturing. Light
manufacturing that is clean and electronic."^[Brandin oral history, 42.]
Stanford took this to heart, renaming the Industrial Park to Stanford Research
Park shortly after the Battle of the Hills in order to avoid industrializations
association with the area. But Stanford's belief that the issue revolved around
semantics -- that the word "industry" in Stanford Industrial Park was confusing
residents -- reveals that Stanford had no understanding of citizen's real
concerns. Citizens rightfully argued that industrialization -- light
manufacturing or otherwise -- was going to have an enormous impact on the
environment.^[@omara2005cities, 137.] Frequently claims of "clean" industry were
revealed to be false.  Complaints about light and noise pollution could be
controlled to a degree by Stanford, but other pollutants -- radiation, smog, and
toxic solvents -- would remain uncontrolled, sometimes invisible, and have
greater repercussions. One resident noted in the heat of the Battle of the Hills
debate that a Lockheed plant hear his home resulted in a "federal agency [that]
has been checking the shrubs in our back yard for radioactivity."^["Pros and
Cons of Foothill Industry Zone Debated," Palo Alto Times, April 21, 1960, 13.]
No amount of planning, architectural prowess, and top-notch landscaping could
get around the visible and invisible pollution resulting from high technology
manufacturing.

## The Committee for Green Foothills

The controversies over Stanford Industrial Park and Stanford's economic
development plans spurred the emergence of grassroots environmental activism. In
the wake of Stanford's victory, residents of the area, increasingly concerned
that Stanford might overrun the foothills and irritated by the university's
seemingly cavalier attitude towards citizen's concerns and favoritism towards
industry, continued organizing. Among the most prominent groups to emerge was
the Committee for Green Foothills. Formed in the living room of Ruth
Spangenberg, the Committee included Stanford alumni and area professionals,
including the well-known writer and Stanford creative writing professor Wallace
Stegner and former county planner Morgan Stedman.^[Stegner oral history,
Bancroft, p. 8.] The Committee was founded, Wallace Stegner explained, because
"of things that seemed to be happening in the hills that we didn't like to see
happen" and a "fear of what Stanford might do in the hills."^[Stegner oral
history, Bancroft, pp. 7-8.]

The organization was not anti-growth per se, and distinct from the no-growth 
activists of the 1970s; rather, the organization and its members feared that 
city leaders were not giving enough attention to the potential problems of 
industrial growth and felt that residents should be protected from 
encroachments from industry. 

The Committee got its first major test in 1965 when plans were announced to
extend Page Mill Road past Frenchman's Tower, a local landmark on Old Page Mill
Road at the base of the foothills. Concerned that the new road would mean
building a cement canal to replace the creek that ran along the road, the
Committee  organized resistance to the plan.^[Stegner oral history, Bancroft, p.
9.] They formed the Page Mill Co-ordinating Committee in 1965 to begin
pressuring Stanford to reroute the road.

The Committee's attitude towards nature reveals an attitude of declension.
Industry was the serpent in the garden of the world, tempting a fall from grace.
Indeed, the Judeo-Christian language was so attractive that Wallace Stegner
referred to the Santa Clara Valley as a "brief Eden" that disappeared under the
encroaching sprawl of suburbanization and industrialization.
