Joe Ruscigno spent his lifetime working the land on his San Jose farm.  Son of 
first-generation Italian immigrants, Ruscigno and his family had run the farm 
since the 1940s.^[U.S. Census, 1940. 
http://www.archives.com/1940-census/joe-ruscigno-ca-34378841.] But in 1952 he 
gave up tending land for tearing up land. "Guess I've pulled out 150 acres of 
trees since the first of the year," he told a *San Francisco Chronicle* 
reporter. Ruscigno lamented the uprooting of the fruit trees to the bulldozer 
he now controlled, but "what can you do? . . . The subdivisions were coming in 
all around us and when they made a good offer I sold out."^["Santa Clara 
County — Scene of the Big Boom," San Francisco Chronicle, May 11, 1952.] In 
the decades after 1945, every municipality in the Bay Area participated in the 
process of metropolitan development and, by extension, the erosion of 
agricultural land. San Jose, the largest city in the Valley, was composed 
primarily of subdivisions of single-family homes that lacked the industrialism 
of its northerly neighbors, especially Palo Alto and Sunnyvale that hosted the 
majority of high-tech industry.^[An urban planning study by the Palo Alto 
Planning Commission noted in 1974 that the 1970 Census reported 50,282 persons 
employed in Palo Alto, the highest ratio of jobs to population in any Bay Area 
community, and that between 1960 and 1970 commuting workers increased from 
20,000 to 40,000 while those commuting out of Palo Alto dropped slightly. Palo 
Alto Planning Commission, Palo Alto Comprehensive Plan Impact Report, July 1, 
1974, p. 45. See also Paul Griffin and Ronald Chatham, "An Industrial 
Analysis: North Santa Clara County," Appendix A: Employee Work-Trip Charts, 
County of Santa Clara Planning Department, 1958.] By the 1970s, San Jose had 
become so suburban that researchers at Rand labeled the city "a bedroom 
community for its suburbs"^[Daniel J. Alesch and Robert Levine, Growth in San 
Jose (Santa Monica: Rand, 1973), viii.] and referred to Santa Clara County "a 
giant suburb" of San Francisco.^[Daniel J. Alesch, Local Government's Ability 
to Manage Growth in a Metropolitan Context (Santa Monica: Rand, 1974), 16.] 
The city lacked an urban core of business surrounded by bedroom communities, 
leading urban historian Robert Fishman to call San Jose the "archetypal 
technoburb."^[@fishman1987bourgeois, 17.] 

Ruscigno's experience reflected the shifting land use of the South Bay. As the 
Valley's orchards disappeared underneath suburban tracts, the bulldozer came 
to symbolize the progress of postwar urban transformations. Between 1935 and 
1957, over 70,000 acres of orchards left production as suburban development 
accelerated.^[Roy Hitchcock, "Taking the Pulse of the Prune," California 
Farmer, September 14, 1957.] "The most common sounds heard in the Santa Clara 
Valley this spring is not the call of the meadowlark in the tall grass among 
the orchards," reported the San Francisco Chronicle, "but the roar of the 
bulldozer ripping up rows of fruit trees and the rhythmic sound of the 
pounding hammer."^["Santa Clara County -- Scene of the Big Boom," San 
Francisco Chronicle, May 11, 1952.] San Jose became an icon of suburban growth 
in the mid-1950s, an oft-cited example of how cities should engage in urban 
planning and aggressive development in postwar America until the 1970s, when 
critics leveled charges against the sprawl, environmental damage, congestion, 
and spatial patterns of industrialization and suburbanization.

![Clearing out orchards. *Planning Progress, 1956*.](figures/progress_bulldozer.png)

San Jose's pattern of residential and industrial development was distinct from 
other cities in the Bay Area. Northern Bay Area cities — Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, 
Mountain View, Santa Clara — tended to build more industry than housing 
throughout the postwar decades, leading eventually to severe housing and 
utility shortages and traffic congestion.^[The City of Palo Alto was already 
facing severe housing shortages as early as 1945. When Wallace and Mary 
Stegner moved to Stanford, they were unable to purchase a home in the city. 
Instead, the Stegner's originally tried to set up the community of Ladero with 
other Stanford professors before eventually settling in Los Altos Hills. 
Wallace Stegner, "Four Hundred Families Plan a House, "The Magazine of the 
Year, April 1947, 63-66; Jackson J. Benson, Wallace Stegner: His Life and 
Times (New York: Viking, 1996), 152, 153, 195.] San Jose, on the other hand, 
housed almost half of the county's population, but provided only one-third of 
the jobs since most industry tended to cluster around Stanford 
University.^[@findlay1993magic, p. 156.] By examining "the Capital of 
Silicon Valley," we can better understand the process of residential 
suburbanization and the environmental limits to city growth. Such limits came 
primarily in two forms, the first from residents who began encouraging limited 
growth, and the second by the environment itself.  Looking at the relationship 
between metropolitan fragmentation, suburban economic regulation, and 
burgeoning environmental activism, all across the Valley newcomers fought with 
farmers, planners, agency officials, and elected politicians to determine 
whose vision of the Valleys' future would prevail. Zoning and regulation 
became tools to protect what residents viewed as encroachments onto their 
suburban investments.^[Aaron Cavin's dissertation is especially noteworthy in 
this regard, in which he examines the racial and spatial politics of Santa 
Clara Valley. See, especially, @cavin2012siliconvalley, chapter 6.] 

Historians have debated the issue of whether criticisms of
urban growth and growth control really reflected an environmental
concern on the part of suburbanites. Mike Davis, for example, sees
growth control not as a concern about the environment but rather a
protection of property values.^[Mike Davis, *City of Quartz*, 188.] Other
environmental historians such as Adam Rome challenge this view,
identifying growth control as a genuine environmental reaction to
suburbanization. Historian Peter Siskind notes that growth controls "at
once emerged from and sought to recast post-New Deal growth liberalism;
their politics cannot be confined in the simple categories of backlash,
antistatism, or conservatism that dominate our understanding of suburban
politics."^[@siskind2006discontents, p. 163. See also Dyble, "Revolt Against
Sprawl: Transportation and the Origins of the Marin County
Growth-Control Regime"; @scott2008hip.] In San Jose, the process of rapid
growth, loss of agricultural land, and eventual resistance to growth
gives a richer story of urban growth and resistance to growth.

<!-- Goal: How does San Jose try to reinvent itself as an
industrial/residential capital, and how does that drive to shift the
landscape (agriculture -> industry/housing) affect the
environment/politics? -->

# A Booster Ethos

Historians have begun to confront the history of San Jose and its rapid
urbanization, tracing the social and cultural challenges that emerged in
the decades after World War II.^[See, specifically, @abbott1995frontier; 
@cavin2012siliconvalley;
@matthews2003dreams; @trounstine1982movers.] Fewer, however, have chronicled the changes to the
physical environment that amplified urban problems and exacerbated
tensions in the urban-rural fringe.^[Exceptions to this include Pellow
and Park; Ted Smith book. These accounts have tended to focus on
environmental justice and place much of their attention on occupational
health, working conditions, and electronic waste.] Waterworks,
utilities, regrading, freeways, subdivisions, tearing out orchards, even
the very choice of where to annex land were more than infrastructural
change; they were the pinnacle of a hybrid landscape that was less
predictable and more difficult to control than the one they had altered.

The origins of San Jose's postwar pro-growth attitude traces itself to
the 1940s when, in 1944, an ambitious group of young merchants, lawyers,
industrialists, and property owners formed the Progress Committee.
Members of the Progress Committee took issue with City Manager C. B.
Goodwin and political boss Charles "Boss" Bigley, accusing them of not
doing enough to promote San Jose's development. Voters, and the
newspaper, agreed. Aided by the newspaper's endorsement, the Progress
Committee swept the city council elections in 1944 and committed
themselves to building "a new metropolis in the place of sleepy San
Jose."^[Quoted in @trounstine1982movers, 87.] The new members
of the city council promptly fired the police chief and fire chief,
charging them with "bossism," "mismanagement," and "political
interference," and fired City Manager Goodwin.^[@trounstine1982movers, 87.] 

Their first plans were aimed at attracting industry to San
Jose. With subsidies from city and county government, the Chamber of
Commerce began a \$60,000 advertising campaign that lured the industries
of Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation, already a local to the area,
International Business Machines, General Electric, Pittsburgh Steel,
Owens-Corning, and Kaiser.^[@trounstine1982movers, 88.] Some of
their initiatives fell under criticism, when, for example, in 1946 a
fellow member called the committee "reactionaries" and accused them of
selling municipal land to companies well below market value. A court
agreed with these charges. Others disagreed with plans for the private
ownership of water infrastructure, arguing instead for municipal
ownership. The Progress Committee, along with the newspaper, silenced
such criticism with accusations of socialism.^[@trounstine1982movers, 88.] 

The city council, however, did come closer to bringing the
Committee's vision to life. The Committee desired to see a new city
hall, a deep water port north of the city, improved sewer system,
streets, storm drains, and an airport. Building such infrastructure
projects required the approval of the votes, who voted on general
obligation bonds that allowed the city to borrow money long-term at low
interest rates. These bonds were paid for by increases on property taxes
— a move voters often disagreed with. Bonds were repeatedly voted down,
even as the city dealt with its unique problem of sewage given its
widespread cannery business. Voters especially refused to give special
treatment to canneries, even when the state of California declared San
Jose in violation of pollution regulations in 1948.^[@trounstine1982movers, 88.] 

The Progress Committee dissolved shortly after their victory, but their 
pro-growth ideology remained entrenched in San Jose politics for the next 
three decades.

# Progress Town U.S.A

World War II and the postwar years witnessed an explosion in the
population of northern California. San Francisco, Oakland, and Berkeley,
the traditional urban centers in the Bay Area, had seen their
populations rise during the war years, but in the postwar years
populations began moving to the suburbs. Out of the nine counties of the
Bay Area, Santa Clara County ranked first in the size of its population
increase (see figure). Throughout the 1940s the population of Santa
Clara County nearly doubled, and by the mid-1950s nearly 4,000 new
people were moving to the county every month. The county's 1950
population of 290,547 people exploded to 642,365 by 1960, surpassing San
Francisco as the region's urban center. By the end of the 1970s,
1,065,313 people called San Jose home. The arrival of so many people in
a short amount of time led to subdivisions spreading throughout the
Valley.^[Belser, *Planning Progress 1956*, 2; U.S. Bureau of the Census,

The rapid rise of the Bay Area followed a wartime and postwar trend
throughout the American West. New opportunities in western cities after
a decade of economic depression led migrants to metropolitan areas to
take jobs in wartime industries in the 1940s. The American West
especially felt the impact of this shift, leading urban historian Carl
Abbott to remark that the migration led "the entire West into the
half-century of head-long urbanization."^[@abbott1995frontier,
p. 4.] Western metro areas became centers of the new economy --- Dallas, San
Francisco, San Jose, Denver, Albuquerque --- based on high technology,
services, and tourism and recreation.^[On the metropolitan West, see
@abbott2008cities; @abbott1995frontier; See also @gomez2000golden; 
@fogelson1967fragmented; @isselcherny1982sanfrancisco; 
@wileygottleib1982empires.] The region
that Bernard DeVoto once described as a "plundered province" had become
an economic pacesetter in the latter twentieth century, propelled by
world war, new economic pursuits, demographic shifts, and federal
funding.^[Bernard DeVoto, "The West: A Plundered Province," Harper's
Magazine 169 (August 1934), 355-364. On the West and World War II, see

San Jose lay at the center of northern California's population
boom (see figure). A rural farming community of 68,457 in 1940, San Jose
would be among the top ten largest metropolitan areas in the nation by
the end of the century. By the 1960s the town's population numbered
204,196, and doubled by 1970 to 445,779.^[U.S. Bureau of the Census,
1960 Census, Santa Clara County, n.d., census.abag.ca.gov; U.S. Bureau
of the Census, 1970 Census, Santa Clara County, n.d.,
census.abag.ca.gov.] By century's end, San Jose would become the largest
city in northern California and largely served as the suburban home for
the Bay Area's technology commuters working in Sunnyvale, Mountain View,
and Palo Alto.^[U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1950 Census, Santa Clara
County, n.d., census.abag.ca.gov; U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1960
Census, Santa Clara County, n.d., census.abag.ca.gov; U.S. Bureau of the
Census, 1970 Census, Santa Clara County, n.d., census.abag.ca.gov; U.S.
Bureau of the Census,1980 Census, Santa Clara County, n.d.,
census.abag.ca.gov.] The city limits rapidly expanded from 17 square
miles in 1950 to 137 square miles in 1970, sprawling awkwardly across
the Valley floor and foothills.^[Stanford Environmental Law Review, *San Jose: 
Sprawling City: A Report on Land use Policies and Practices in San Jose, 
California*, March 1971, 2.] The city grew so rapidly that street map makers could not
keep up with the changes, finding their maps outdated just five months
after printing; the city
began selling monthly packets of stickers correcting areas of the master
map that people placed upon their maps in order to maintain its
accuracy.^["County Grows Too Fast for Mapmakers," *Palo Alto Times*,
September 12, 1952; @cavin2012siliconvalley, 209; "Notes for a Gazetteer," *The New Yorker*, May 4, 1963, p.
148.]

The combination of the population boom and the booster ethos of the city
council fueled a political culture that was accommodating to business
and favorable towards developers. To fund such growth the city needed
long-term, low-interest bonds, which required approval by the city's
voters whose property taxes helped pay back the loans. Since the days of
the Progress Committee, San Jose city leaders faced reluctant voters who
continually refused to fund general obligation bonds. But with the
city's rapidly expanding population and attendant needs to support the
newcomers — mainly, infrastructure that included roads, utilities, and
sewers — the city needed to find someone to convince voters to support
the measures they believed necessary for San Jose's growth. 

The city council found that person in Anthony P. "Dutch" Hamann. Hamann 
epitomized San Jose's postwar pro-growth outlook. The forty-year-old former 
businessman, teacher, and oil company representative had a strong attachment 
to the city and solid connections throughout the community.^[@trounstine1982movers, 89.] A graduate of the University of Santa Clara, Hamann 
had not served in political office until he was appointed by the city council 
in 1950 in a split 4 to 3 vote. As the city began its drive for growth, Hamann 
hoped to avoid the fate that had befallen his home of Orange County in 
Southern California with many competing medium-sized cities.^["Hamann: San 
Jose's Growth Guru," *San Jose Mercury*, 1999.] He wanted San Jose to dominate 
the county, and thus avoid what he saw as petty competition among small towns. 
To grow and make available the funds to sustain growth, Hamann reasoned, the 
city needed to annex and tax.^[@matthews2003dreams, 96.] "You don't build 
a city by staying in a vacuum," Hamann declared. "You build, you sell. . 
. . And I was the gun for hire."^[Hamann quoted in @trounstine1982movers, 96.] 

And build San Jose did. The city approved over 1,400 annexations between 1945 
and 1970 including many that were narrow strips --- "shoestring" annexations 
--- snaking outward, sometimes only on one half of a street, to capture a 
desirable subdivision, commercial center, or street intersection. In some 
areas, annexations became a tool of coercion. Annex enough areas around 
hold-outs, city officials reasoned, and pockets of non-annexed land would have 
little choice but to succumb.^["Annexations by Year", 2011, City of San Jose 
Planning Division; "City Size by Year", 2011, City of San Jose Planning 
Division; Belser, *Planning Progress 1956*, 47; @trounstine1982movers, 93; 
"Correcting San Jose's Boomtime Mistake," *Business Week*, September 19, 1970, 
p. 74; Stanford Law Review, *San Jose*, 5.] Hamann's drive for land became so aggressive that his 
staff became known as "Dutch's Panzer division" — named after the swift 
motorized armored tank squadrons of the Third Reich — as annexations sprawled 
outward from the city core.^[@trounstine1982movers, 93.] "They say San Jose is going to become another Los Angeles," Hamann 
rebuked his critics. "Believe me, I'm going to do the best in my power to make 
that come true."^[Stanford Environmental Law Society, *San Jose: Sprawling 
City*, 17. See also Matthews, "Los Angeles of the North," *Journal of Urban 
History*, ###.] Under Hamann's tenure, the San Jose Chamber of Commerce spent 
nearly \$1 million to attract new industries to the city. The population 
boomed and the city sprawled. "It was just growth, growth, 
growth," Al Ruffo, San Jose's mayor in the 1940s, recalled approvingly. "That 
was everybody's song.  And Dutch sang it the loudest."^["Hamann: San Jose's 
Growth Guru," *San Jose Mercury*, 1999.] 

San Jose's pro-growth contingent received
enthusiastic support from the city's newspaper, the *San Jose Mercury*,
and its new manager, Joe Ridder. The Ridder newspaper empire owned
several large publications in the United States, including the *St. Paul
Dispatch*, *Duluth Herald*, *Manhattan's Journal of Commerce*, and the
*Seattle Times*. When the family of Everis Hayes sold the morning *News* and
evening *Mercury* in 1952 after the paper owner's death, the Ridder family
promptly purchased the newspaper.^["The Ridders Buy Again," *Time*, August
4, 1952.] Joe Ridder was sent to manage the new daily paper and defined
the paper's revised pro-growth mission, saying that he hoped to make the
*Mercury News* "not only among the best newspapers on the Pacific Coast
but a vital and constructive force in the development of San Jose and
its territory."^[*San Jose Mercury*, July 1952, quoted in 
@trounstine1982movers, p. 89; @abbott1995frontier, p. 40.] When
asked why he was so enthusiastic about San Jose's growth, Ridder
responded: "Trees don't read newspapers."^[Quoted in Stanford Law Review, *San Jose*, 
17.]

Although much of Hamann and the city council's drive appeared aimed at
attracting industry to the city, San Jose instead witnessed the most
growth in housing and residential developments. San Jose gained 25,000
new residents in 1953, and another 31,400 a year later. Residential
construction totaled \$84 million in 1954, much of which was in
unincorporated county territory. Residential construction employed
35,000 people and built 8,300 homes, while industrial and commercial
construction topped \$48 million. Banks in the county lent out more
than \$202 million through FHA, Cal-Vet, and other programs meant to
entice the construction of homes.^["1954—A Year of Amazing Growth in
County," *San Jose Mercury*, January 3, 1955.] Throughout the entire
county, housing subdivisions continued to increase. In 1950 Santa Clara
County witnessed 144 subdivisions build homes on 6,833 lots. A year
later the figures dropped slightly with only ninety-eight subdivisions
and 4,616 homes. But in 1952 construction jumped again, reaching 144
subdivisions and 6,437 homes. By 1955, the county saw 177 subdivisions
and the construction of 10,157 homes for families moving to the
area.^["Population Growth Created Demand for Housing; Subdivisions on
Grand Scale Provided the Homes," *San Jose Mercury*, January 15, 1956, p.
3P; "198 Tracts Provide 11,631 Home Sites," *San Jose Mercury*, January
15, 1960.] The county estimated that as much as 75% of the population
owned their homes.^["Estimate of Homeowners: 75%," *San Jose Mercury*,
January 15, 1956, p. 3P.] 

Along with such changes came new municipal projects. The city council finally 
convinced voters to approve bond measures, beginning in 1955 when San Jose 
voters approved bonds supporting the construction of a new City Hall, new 
hospital facilities, new jail and court buildings, and the construction of a 
new YMCA facility. The Progress Committee ran up against resistance from 
voters in the 1940s as they rejected general obligation bond votes. By the 
late 1950s residents had reversed course, approving over \$134 million in 
general obligation bonds in elections held in 1957, 1961, 1966, and 
1969.^[Trounstine, *Movers and Shakers*, pp. 95-96.] 

Residential growth, home ownership, and widespread annexation in San Jose was 
taken as a sign of progress.<!--[ Look into Cohen's Consumer Republic here on 
home ownership; also Crabgrass Frontier.]--> In 1956 the *San Jose Mercury* ran 
a special series on "Metropolitan San Jose --- Progress Town U.S.A." detailing 
the various changes in the city the newspaper considered signs of a bright new 
future.^["Metropolitan San Jose --- Progress Town U.S.A," *San Jose Mercury*, 
January 15, 1956.] The newspaper specifically called out agriculture, 
industry, education, culture, and recreation, and residential living as key 
indicators in San Jose's new prosperous future. The Mercury praised the 
industrial diversification of the city and its promise of "year-round 
employment and production" instead of the seasonal employment often found in 
the agricultural industries. A town less reliant on agriculture meant avoiding 
economic dips, more opportunities for employment and education, and additional 
wealth.^["Diversification Gives Solid Balance to Area," *San Jose Mercury*, 
January 15, 1956.] 

In 1956 the *Mercury* eagerly applauded the planning and development of San 
Jose.

San Jose's rapid growth came with a price. Nearby towns attempted
to protect themselves from becoming part of the city. In the 1950s,
suburban governments expanded rapidly. For various reasons, towns were
not willing partners in San Jose's growth and instead sought strict
economic regulations within the city boundaries in order to control the
development and character of the municipality. Some cities attempted
incorporation as one method for protecting themselves from San Jose's
sprawling annexations and maintain their identities. Campbell became a
city in 1952, followed by Milpitas in 1954, Cupertino in 1955, and
Saratoga in 1956.^["Hamann: San Jose's Growth Guru," *San Jose Mercury*,
1999.] County-wide, between 1952 and 1957 seven cities incorporated,
thereby doubling the number of municipalities in the county.^[Cavin,
491.] In other cases, cities found themselves resisting attempts at
municipal consolidation. In the case of Alviso and Milpitas...

The situation was exacerbated by larger towns who likewise annexed large
swaths of land. In particular, San Jose was competing with Santa Clara —
what locals began calling the "annexation wars" — in order to maintain
its own influence and growth in the South Bay.

José and the Bayshore Freeway between San Francisco and San

# Green Gold and Green Belts

As city leaders defined the details of San Jose's suburban future in the
late 1940s and early 1950s, a sizable contingent of city residents
questioned whether the link between growth and prosperity was certain.

The rapid growth of the city led farmers to feel threatened. Industrial and 
residential lots were replacing one acre of farmland every ninety minutes in 
1959.^[Cavin, "Borders of Citizenship," 209.] Often land developers would pay 
for property at rates well above what farmers originally paid. When the Santa 
Clara fruit grower Carl Wesley Haman died in 1955, his 41.44-acre lot was 
purchased by a Palo Alto developer for \$287,000 --- over seventeen times more 
than what Haman paid when he originally purchased the land. Desirable land 
could fetch upwards of \$7,000 an acre by the mid-1950s.^["41.44 Acres Bring 
Price of \$287,000," San Jose Mercury, September 17, 1955; Cavin, "Borders of 
Citizenship," 212.] By the 1970s, pockets of agricultural land were being sold 
for $18,000 an acre, and one land owner refused an offer of 
\$2,300,000.^[Stanford Law Review, *San Jose*, 8.] Often the small farmers 
could not afford to stay in business in the face of rising tax assessments, 
while large landowners held out to fetch higher prices.^[McGaffney, "Urban 
Expansion — Will it ever Stop?" 510.] San Jose, T. H. Bowden was already 
noting in 1937, "might literally be said to have been carved from a forest of 
fruit trees, as most of the residential sections were orchards prior to being 
subdivided, and many of the original trees still ornament the gardens of the 
invading residences."^[T. H. Bowden, *Report of a Survey in San Jose, 
California*, (Washington, D.C.: Division of Research and Statistics, Home 
Owners' Loan Corporation, September 18, 1937), 2, quoted in Cavin, "Borders of 
Citizenship," 208.] The rapid suburbanization of San Jose eradicated farmland. 
Between 1935 and 1957, nearly 70,000 acres of farmland left production.^[Roy 
Hitchock, "Taking the Pulse of the Prune," California Farmer, September 4, 
1957; "The Indispensable Man at Harvest Time," San Jose Mercury, August 28, 
1955.] "As the people came," the *San Jose Mercury* noted in 1956, "the orchards 
went."^["Population Growth Created Demand for Housing; Subdivisions on Grand 
Scale Provided the Homes," *San Jose Mercury*, January 15, 1956, p. 3P.] 

As shown above, the city had no problem annexing land for what they saw as the 
appropriate and correct use: new industry and new suburban homes. But this 
vision of the landscape came into conflict with farmers, whose own ideas about 
land use also meant protecting their livelihoods.  Right as suburbs were 
expanding across the valley floor, their farming neighbors began organizing an 
effort at agricultural land preservation.

Santa Clara's farmers caught the eye of William Whyte, a leading critic
of suburban sprawl. The disappearing orchards and countryside --- what
many equated as "nature" --- gained the attention of William H. Whyte, a
nationally-known critic of suburban development. Writing in 1958, Santa
Clara County was his example of sprawl --- "vast, smog-filled deserts that
are neither city, suburb, nor country."^[Whyte, "Urban Sprawl," 124. On
Whyte and urban sprawl see Rome, *The Bulldozer in the Countryside*,
119–152.]

# Sinking Land and Sprawling Cities

Suburban homeowners came to expect that the places they moved to not
only had low property taxes, provided property ownership as an avenue
for upward mobility, and segregated neighborhoods, but a pleasant
environment as well.^[On the issues of social mobility, radicalized
suburban space, and taxes, see Self, American Babylon, 96-100; Ronald
Tobey, Charles Wetherell, and Jay Bringham, "Moving Out and Settling In:
Residential Mobility, Home Owning, and the Public Enframing of
Citizenship, 1921-1950," American Historical Review 95 (December 1990);
Nicolaides, My Blue Heaven, 185-237.] Such views put residents at odds
with the concerns of developers and boosters, who tended to privilege
the sale of land for profit, taxes, and jobs --- the very core of
"growth." But home-owning suburbanites approached property differently,
expecting that the place they inhabited had access to public parks, open
space, well-kept lawns, and access to recreation. Property, then, was
more than just the accumulation (and production) of capital. Property's
proximity to nature mattered a great deal to suburbanites, manifesting
itself in a sort of "aesthetic capital" that could not be measured by
dollar amounts. Suburbs were not just efforts towards organizing space;
their very proximity to "nature" led suburbanites to define their space
in aesthetic terms and take measures to protect their idea of "nature."

Advertisements for subdivisions often highlighted the natural
surroundings as a way to entice prospective homebuyers. Yet often the
"natural" environment --- often, in this case, meaning orchards and
farmland --- were quickly giving way to suburban housing developments. It
was not uncommon for a new homeowner, enticed by the idea of a
countryside home, to suddenly be in the midst of sprawling subdivisions
in only a few years.

![Subdivisions
among the orchards. Planning for Growth: A Report on the Status of City
and County Planning in California (Sacramento: Assembly of the State of
California, 1955), 42.](figures/subdivision_orchards.png)

The very location of annexations and subdivisions ignored potential
environmental issues, or introduced new problems the city failed to
anticipate. The City of San Jose eagerly approved subdivisions in
floodplains, hillsides, fault lines, and wetlands. Such flexible land
use gave San Jose city leaders what they wanted, drawing developers to
the city rather than its neighbors whose land use policies were more
restrictive.^[Troustine, Movers and Shakers, 95.] Sometimes housing
developments occurred on land originally blocked by the county as
improper for development, only to be annexed by a city and opened to
development^["Proper Storm Drainage Possible, Says Planner," San Jose
Mercury, January 5, 1956.]. No type of land, it seemed, would be off the
table for San Jose civic leaders. 

San Jose had to confront more than the
politics surrounding the environment. They confronted the environment
itself, which had its own ways of dictating the limits of urban growth.
The approval of development in areas prone to flooding provides one
example of the environmental limits of growth. The city's poor planning
exacerbated flooding problems. As more and more soil was paved over or
built upon, the less area remained to absorb excess water.^[Leonard
Downie Jr., "A Misplanned Suburb," Washington Post, December 30, 1973,
p. C5.] Urban development changed the Valley's drainage system,
upsetting centuries of drainage patterns that had created hundreds of
small streams and areas for groundwater absorption. Storm runoff and
flooding became problems in ways it had previously not been.^[Bill
Zanker to Don Edwards, February 11, 1966, Box 72, Folder 3, Don Edwards
Congressional Papers, MSS-1995-001, San Jose State University Library
Special Collections and Archives.] Furthermore, building in low areas
frequently flooded in winter and spring rains, places often sold to
lower-income families.^[Downie, "A Misplanned Suburb," Washington Post,
December 30, 1973, p. C5. According to Downie, such sales were made
primarily to lower-income families and allowed developers "profit
risk-free." The homes were guaranteed by FHA loans, which were often
leased to black and Hispanic homebuyers.] 

Drainage channels themselves
were altered as well. The Guadalupe River and Coyote Creek, which whisk
water from the southern rim of the Diablo Mountains to the San Francisco
Bay, experienced a change in their grade from the subsidence. In other
words, the sinking land caused the rivers to adjust their angle more
sharply downward, causing them to transport more and larger river
material than they had previously.^[J. Robert Roll, "Effect of
Subsidence on Well Fields," Journal (American Water Works Association)
59, no. 1 (January 1, 1967): 80–88.] 

In addition to runoff and drainage
issues, communities faced an issue with ground sinking, a phenomenon
known as subsidence. Subsidence occurred as groundwater stores were
depleted and the soil and clay above the aquifer compressed from the
weight above it. Subsidence exacerbated flooding problems. The area had
been facing problems of subsidence since the early twentieth century as
groundwater levels dropped as much as ninety-five feet from heavy
pumping from the county's more than 2,000 wells.^[Scott, San Francisco
Bay Area, 229-230.] Alviso, located at the southern tip of the San
Francisco Bay to the north of San Jose, sank six feet in the postwar
years through a combination of agricultural groundwater pumping and,
later, increased water pumping to supply subdivisions. By comparison,
San Jose's downtown sank fourteen feet before groundwater replenishment
efforts finally ended the subsidence in the late 1960s. The combined
issues of subsidence and altered drainage patterns dramatically collided
in a Christmas 1955 deluge that flooded nearby Sunnyvale and Alviso,
requiring the Santa Clara County Flood Control and Water District and
the Army Corps of Engineers to begin building a system of levies and
dikes to protect the communities.^[Joseph F. Poland, "Case History No.
9.14. Santa Clara Valley, California, USA," in Guidebook to Studies of
Land Subsidence Due to Ground-water Withdrawal, ed. Joseph F. Poland
(Paris: UNESCO, 1984), 281, 283; Andrew Trice, Review of Economic
Aspects of the Corps of Engineers' Draft Report on Coyote Creek, March
22, 1971, Box 84, Folder 140, Don Edwards Congressional Papers,
MSS-1995-01, San Jose State University Library Special Collections and
Archives; "Proper Storm Drainage Possible, Says Planner," San Jose
Mercury, January 5, 1956; "Orchardist Orders Dike Builders Off His
Land," San Jose Mercury, January 5, 1956; "A ‘Walled' City of Alviso May
Be Answer to Problem," San Jose Mercury, January 6, 1956, p. 4.]

Subsidence unwittingly caused infrastructure problems as well. As
aquifer levels fell, farmers had to run their wells deeper and, in turn,
use more electrical power and larger pump equipment to bring the water
to the surface. Furthermore, the sinking of the ground caused damage to
well casings, sewers, water mains, and other underground
infrastructure.^[Scott, San Francisco Bay Area, 230.] At the very moment
that the city needed its infrastructure the most, the rapid urbanization
it was promoting was putting stress on existing systems.

Rapid urbanization also meant the quick disappearance of open spaces and
undeveloped land, despite the goals of the agricultural zoning laws.
When county planning director Karl Belser issued the county's planning
goals in 1956, he urged the "preservation of scenic beauty" and the
maintenance of undeveloped land for the purpose of "relief" from the
city. The county sought scenic roads projects to limit the "unsightly
development" on the land and provide "visual amenity" for the
area.^[Belser, *Planning Progress 1956*, 12. See also Belser's remarks in
*Beauty for America: Proceedings of the White House Conference on Natural
 Beauty* (Washington, D.C.: Government Printing Office, 1965), 190-295.]
Journalist Leonard Downie, writing about the city in 1973, concluded
that all that remained of scenic open space was the "carefully tended
and regularly watered greenery along the shoulders of the county's many
freeways."^[Downie, "A Misplanned Suburb," Washington Post, December 30,
1973. Quotes from Cavin, 497.]

![*The Nation*, March 8, 1965.](figures/TheNation-bulldozedcrops.png)

<!--

*As early as 1956, county planning director Karl Belser declared that the
planning department aimed for the "preservation of scenic beauty." The
county worked to establish undeveloped areas that would provide visual
"relief." It embarked on a "scenic roads" project, an attempt to limit
"unsightly 16 development" on the sides of highways and to landscape
them for "visual amenity." At the 1965 White House Conference on Natural
Beauty, Belser argued that counties and local jurisdictions should
establish open spaces for the gaze of suburban residents, asserting "one
of the objectives of local administration shall be to have natural
beauty prevail."17*

Another thought that's forming while working on this chapter on San
Jose: the environmental/conservation argument made by many neighborhood
activists in the 1950s and 1960s referred to the (quickly disappearing)
orchards and farms as a sort of nostalgic ideal of "nature." Wallace
Stegner referred to the Valley's orchards as "a glory" and lamented
their loss. But, fruit production -- especially in San Jose -- was quite
intensive on the environment. San Jose's sewer system was built
specifically to support the fruit canneries, and much of the effluent
produced by the canneries were dumped into the San Francisco Bay for
many years. Agriculture in this part of semiarid California was also
quite water intensive, leading to subsidence in the middle of the
century and exacerbating problems with flooding (electronics
industrialization caused this too). Not to mention the bodily health of
workers who were exposed to pesticides, fertilizers, lye, and other
harsh chemicals used in production and canning. Bloom-time orchards were
probably quite beautiful and better to look at than a warehouse, but
that doesn't mean it was environmentally sustainable.

——

Environmentally-minded suburbanites of the South Bay identified two
issues with San Jose's suburban character overrunning the agricultural
landscape. The first was the loss of prime farmland, which residents
found as threats to food production {…} Second, San Jose residents
lamented the aesthetic losses of the orchards.

Flooding, etc.

Journalist Leonard Downie Jr. remarked in 1973 that San Jose was
remarkable for its "mustard-colored haze" and noted the county's
environmental problems that stemmed from poor planning:

> Automobiles push and shove through crowded concrete corridors of stores,
service stations, car lots and taco stands. Isolated groves of the last
surviving fruit trees fight asphyxiation from the polluted air and
strangulation by the surrounding homes, shopping centers, factories and
freeways. The houses huddle together, back to back and side to side, in
cities of subdivisions without open spaces, parks or even sidewalks.
Many homes just 10 years old slouch in ready-built slums, their gravel
roofs leaking, concrete slab foundations cracked, flimsy veneer doors
and walls warped, stick fences rotting and sparse dirt yards alternately
flooding and heaving. This is Santa Clara County, California, a jigsaw
puzzle of intertwined suburbs beginning 40 miles southeast of San
Francisco.^[Downie, "A Misplanned Suburb," Washington Post, December 30,
1973.]

All that remained for scenic spots, according to Downie, was "the
carefully tended and regularly watered greenery along the shoulders of
the county's many freeways."^[Downie, "A Misplanned Suburb," Washington
Post, December 30, 1973. Quotes from Cavin, 497.]



The planning commission acknowledged in 1956:

> "Old residents view the county's frenzied growth with mixed emotions.
Some see this growth as ‘progress', a condition implying speculative
opportunity or reflected economic benefits. The farmer views with alarm
the disappearance of the county's farmlands under the onslaught of
urbanization. The suburbanite sees his ‘country living' threatened by
the spread of the solid city.... Some are glad for the boom in the
building industry. Others look at our sprawling, rubber stamp
subdivisions and wonder if these are ‘the slums of tomorrow.'"^[Belser,
Planning Progress 1956, 2.]


William Whyte?

*By 1958, Santa Clara County became a national symbol of poor urban
planning. William H. Whyte, a nationally-known critic of suburban
development, used the county as an example of an urban form he called
"sprawl," areas defined as "vast, smog-filled deserts that are neither
city, suburb, nor country." Whyte especially lamented the loss of
agricultural land in the Valley to the "maze of signs and neon lights."
Observers in San Jose commented on the encroaching urban landscape into
the rural landscape. T. H. Bowden noted that the city "might literally
be said to have been carved from a forest of fruit trees, as most of the
residential sections were orchards prior to being subdivided, and many
of the original trees still ornament the gardens of the invading
residences."^[Bowden, Report of a Survey in San Jose, California, 2.]
Thousands of acres of farmland were quickly being converted to
subdivisions.*

*Plans for municipal consolidation in San Jose received resistance from
voters. Civic leaders' drive to expand the city was hardly shared
universally, and homeowners began rejecting the growth-oriented business
elite that had controlled San Jose politics since the 1940s. In 1962,
voters elected Virginia Shaffer to the city council. Shaffer was a
Republican in favor of slow growth and limited government spending. When
a vote came before the seven-person city council to consolidate the city
of Alviso, the only dissenting vote came from Shaffer who argued that
consolidation would do little to help homeowners or
taxpayers.^[Resistance to expansion came, not from liberal
environmentalists, but from conservative Republicans representing
homeowner interests according to Cavin. Cavin, 324.]*

# The Barrio and the Sewers

The environment of the neighborhood generated health problems. In the
early 1950s, lack of sewers and poorly managed cesspools led to an
outbreak of amoebic dysentery in the area. One hundred and twenty 27
five cases occurred on only two blocks.

# Conclusion 

Anchored by the growing high technology industry, the construction of
new homes, interstate highways, and city infrastructure led to
unprecedented growth in the Bay Area, transforming the once
agriculturally-dominated region of rural communities into a sprawling metropolis that quickly filled the flatlands of the valley. The
developments in San Jose mirrored those of other Bay Area cities as Palo
Alto, Sunnyvale, Mountain View, and Santa Clara grew from rural towns
reliant on agriculture to burgeoning cities. San Jose became the model
of urban development. Widespread annexation combined with real estate
development, retail services, and high tech industries became drivers of
population growth. Simultaneously, the concerns of conservationists and
environmentalists over urban growth and the loss of open space was the
first salvo in future struggles over the environment, as highlighted in
the battle over Interstate 280 and the loss of farmland. City
competition over land use and control would only increase over the next
two decades, leading to a growing intensity of environmental critique.
Such concerns would boil over around Stanford in 1960.
