Construction workers sunk their backhoe into the earth in an early
November morning, making way in the soil for a second underground
industrial solvents storage tank for Fairchild Semiconductor. Digging
near an existing storage tank, the workers noticed something about the
soil that did not seem right: the soil seemed exceptionally wet and had
taken on a rust-colored hue. Digging deeper they discovered a leak in
the bottom of the existing storage tank. The leak went undiscovered when
the above-ground gauge that measured the volume of liquid in the tank
failed, and the system normally monitoring incoming chemicals had not
been routinely checked. Concerned about the size of the leak, the
construction crew reported their finding to Fairchild and the Great
Oakes Water Company, which operated drinking water wells nearby that
serviced several thousand residents. The water company closed the wells
immediately. Tests confirmed that an industrial solvent containing the
carcinogen 1,1,1 trichloroethane (TCA) had leaked from the tank and
concentrated in the wells at nearly twenty times the permissible limit
established by the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearly 60,000
gallons of toxic chemicals had leaked from the tank for at least two
years.^[Newspaper clipping, "Water contaminated by leak," *San Jose

\thoughtbreak{Julianne Ross was only nine months old in 1982} when she 
had her first open-heart surgery. When her mother, Lorraine, opened the 
pages of the *San Jose Mercury News* on January 20, she saw the news: 
Fairchild Semiconductor, just a quarter mile from her home, had had an 
environmental catastrophe.  Suddenly, the neighborhood stories and 
problems all made sense. Her neighbors had complained about the water 
tasting and smelling funny, but worse were the four children with birth 
defects, the two miscarriages, and the one stillbirth that had taken 
place on Lorraine's block in the past three years. And her youngest 
child, nine months old at the time, faced multiple congenital heart 
defects.  Lorraine Ross could not help but wonder if the leak and the 
health problems were connected.^[Newspaper clipping, "Water contaminated

News of Fairchild's chemical leak burst onto the scene in early 1982,
and parents whose children had experienced health problems wondered
about a possible link. Who, Lorraine and her neighbors asked, permitted
Fairchild to store toxic chemicals just feet away from public wells? Who
decided what trace elements found in the water was safe for human
consumption? Why had Fairchild and Great Oaks taken so long to inform
the public about the TCA contamination? The chemicals, Lorraine and her
neighbors discovered, went unregulated. No official requirements were in
place for Fairchild to frequently check its storage tanks. The public
was unaware of the sorts of chemicals used by Fairchild and other high
tech manufacturers, and news of the problem only broke when construction
workers discovered there was a problem. Investigations revealed that the
problem was even more widespread. At least an additional 36 leaks had
occurred throughout the Bay Area, including a tetrachloroethylene (TCE)
leak near an Intel plant that had not used the chemical since 1977.

The Bay Area's contaminated soil and water led to a significant shift in
environmental thought. Although many of the other leaks did not threaten
drinking water supplies, the widespread presence of toxic leaks
concerned many residents in the Valley. For the first time, residents
confronted the reality of Silicon Valley's dependence on
chemicals---that the promise of "clean" industry was not so clean after
all. Stories about the toxic leaks, a chemical explosion at Lockheed
that forced the evacuation of 400 people from Palo Alto, the stories of
workers exposed to chemicals that caused hair loss, respiratory
problems, skin infections, and worse. Valley residents came to see the
landscape as tainted. "I'm not anti-semiconductor industry," Lorraine
Ross noted, "but I don't want my health adversely affected by their
profit-making. Companies should be willing to invest a portion of their
profit to ensure they aren't damaging the environment." Studies in 1992
reported that 57 private and 47 public drinking wells were contaminated,
and 66 plots of land were too toxic for people to walk on. County
authorities determined that sixty-five of the seventy-nine companies
they investigated---including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Raytheon, NEC, AMD,
Signetics, and many others---had contaminated the soil beneath their
plants. The federal government eventually declared twenty-nine Superfund
sites---more than any other county in the nation---twenty-four of which
resulted from electronics firms.^[@pellowpark2002dreams, 75--76.]

The presence of synthetic and industrial contaminates was a revelation
to Valley suburbanites. In earlier decades, cities had dealt with the
problem of human waste as public health officials learned how to manage
the problem. Even in San Jose, the city had learned to deal with its
problem of sewage and cannery effluence though an efficient sewer system
that could handle massive volumes of detritus. But now cities of the Bay
Area were on the front lines of widespread contamination by high tech
toxics, a situation the region was unaware and unprepared to confront.

The proximity of pollutants near suburban areas along the Peninsula 
resulted as a consequence of the Bay Area's lack of residential and 
industrial urban planning. Because Bay Area cities thought little about 
the layout of their environs, industrial facilities and warehouses 
frequently turned up alongside residential developments rather than 
isolated from the places where people lived. The natural boundaries of 
the Peninsula---the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west and the San 
Francisco Bay to the east---also kept suburban areas and industry in 
close proximity to one another. The simply lacked the space to expand.  
The emerging crisis broadened the coalescing environmental movement, 
even among those who never considered themselves environmentalists. The 
daily lived experiences of the Bay Area's suburbanites expected clean 
tap water and believed that the industries near their communities were 
clean and green. The toxic landscape shattered that perception.

<!--

### Murky Waters

World War II had transformed the Bay Area's watershed landscape. The two
major rivers, the Guadalupe River and the Coyote Creek, and its
tributaries were only the most visible signs of the Bay Area's water
landscape. But in the 1980s the focus of environmentalists turned to the 
hidden water---that trapped between layers of clay and gravel beneath 
the surface of the cities.

Flooding confounded those who wanted borders between the physical and
the social. The heavy winter storm in 1955 washed through Alviso, Santa
Clara, and San Jose, causing extensive damage. Asphalt, concrete, and
soil compaction only worsened runoff and amplified the problem of
flooding. City and county planners turned to technology to tame the
floods, looking primarily to the Army Corps of Engineers to fund new
channels and dikes that would funnel water safely into the Bay.
Technology, they hoped, could tame nature.

To city boosters the problem lay with the rivers themselves, not the
dramatic changes that occurred on the lands around the rivers. The
solution to the river's inadequacies could be solved by engineering.
Although floodplains had always been a frequent presence in the
flatlands of the Valley, city boosters and Army Corps engineers saw the
rivers as reformers saw them in the early 1900s---channels for moving
floodwaters away from cities. But the old river had changed.

California enacted state laws in the 1960s governing the regulation of
water.

### "Fairchild or My Child?"

The Los Paseos neighborhood sparked what one newspaper called the "birth 
of an eco-tragedy."^["Birth of an eco-tragedy" *Los Angeles Herald 
Examiner*, February 10, 1982.] Along with the Fairchild leak, the nearby 
International Business Machines facility announced the discovery of a 
TCA leak shortly after the Fairchild leak was revealed. Studies would 
later find that the IBM leak was among the worst in the South Bay, 
contaminating twenty-five public and private wells.^[Peter Murphy, 
"Great Oaks Water Distribution Study," 1988, 1, Folder 1, Box 11, SVTC 
records, SJSU; Ted Smith oral history, Berkeley, 19; "Responsible action 
needed in IBM's toxic waste cleanup," *San Jose Business Journal*, April 
7, 1986, {FILL} SVTC records, SJSU.] To Lorraine Ross and her neighbors, 
the presence of chemicals in the suburban neighborhood was as much a 
spatial experience as a personal one. "It takes a lot of nerve for them 
to invade a pre-existing residential neighborhood, pour dangerous 
chemicals into a leaking tank, poison the surrounding environment and 
hide the fact from the people affected by their negligence."^[Quoted in 
@pellowpark2002dreams, 74.] Ross helped galvanize the community into 
political action, first surveying her neighbors that turned up a list of 
seventy-two people who reported birth defects and health 
problems.^[Lorraine Ross, "State Study Confirms Birth Defect Cluster," 
*Silicon Valley Toxics News* (April 1985), 3; "San Jose Hearing Points 
Up Toxic Risks at Area Plants," *California AFL-CIO News*, February 11, 
1983.] The problem seemed so widespread to not be a coincidence.

Lorraine Ross had relocated her family to Gilroy by 1983, but she 
continued to be a vocal presence in the Bay Area's anti-toxics 
campaign.^["Get tough now to avoid spills," *Gilroy Dispatch*, August 1, 
1983, Folder 5, Box 10, SVTC records, SJSU.] At her new home in Gilroy, 
the presence of industry near suburban areas continued to be a spatial 
experience and informed the political critique of toxics. The disk 
manufacturer Dysan planned a facility at the Santa Teresa Technology 
Park in Gilroy. Although not opposed to its construction, Ross warned 
her new city that they could not "accept the dictates of Realtors and 
developers when it comes to determining the health of our families. You 
all have the right to talk loudly. It's important that Gilroy plan ahead 
for industry."^["Get tough now to avoid spills," *Gilroy Dispatch*, 
August 1, 1983, Folder 5, Box 10, {FILL} SVTC records, SJSU.]

<!--
In 1982, Lorraine Ross found herself becoming a community activist. She 
began connecting with others in Los Paseos to determine if health 
problems were a widespread problem. Surveying others in her 
neighborhood, she turned up a list of seventy-two people who reported 
health problems and birth defects.^[Lorraine Ross, "State Study Confirms 
Birth Defect Cluster," *Silicon Valley Toxics News* (April 1985), 3; 
"San Jose Hearing Points Up Toxic Risks at Area Plants," *California 
AFL-CIO News*, February 11, 1983.] Along with the Fairchild leak, 
International Business Machines in South San Jose, located near the 
Fairchild facility, announced the discovery of a smaller leak in 1983 as 
well, contaminating another Great Oaks well. ^[Peter Murphy, "Great Oaks 
Water Distribution Study," 1988, 1, Folder 1, Box 11, SVTC records, 
SJSU; Ted Smith oral history, Berkeley, 19.] The IBM leak contaminated 
twenty-five public and private wells and had spread to be the largest 
contamination problem in the valley.^["Responsible action needed in 
IBM's toxic waste cleanup," *San Jose Business Journal*, April 7, 1986, 
{FILL} SVTC records, SJSU.] The widespread presence of leaks in San Jose 
led to what one newspaper called the "birth of an eco-tragedy."^["Birth 
of an eco-tragedy" *Los Angeles Herald Examiner*, February 10, 1982.] 
-->

The core debate emerging in the anti-toxics campaign was whether 
scientific evidence existed to support the claim that exposure to 
industrial solvents caused the birth defects. The link between TCA and 
other industrial solvents used by high tech industries and potential 
health problems were unknown in 1982, and even until the late 1970s hazardous 
wastes were treated like any other waste and disposed in landfills or 
surface waters.^[@gottleib2005forcing, 243.] The debate over 
contamination and health originally coalesced around the lack of 
scientific evidence to support the neighborhood's claim. Fairchild 
maintained that the length of exposure to the chemicals were not long 
enough to cause health effects. Basing their claim on the state standard 
for TCA exposure, they argued that those standards were set with 
long-term exposure as the baseline. Fairchild also challenged the 
timeline of the chemical leak and its link to birth defects. The company 
estimated that the leaks began 18 months before they were discovered and 
took up to sixteen months to travel the 2,000 feet to the Great Oaks 
wells. The birth defects that began three years prior, Fairchild argued, 
could not possibly be connected if their leak started relatively 
recently. And, they implicitly argued, neither were the recent 
ones.^["Birth of an eco-tragedy," *Los Angeles Herald Examiner*, 
February 10, 1982.]

Under pressure by neighborhood activists, the county agreed to study the
potential for a link between groundwater contamination and health
problems that plagued Los Paseos in 1982. They formed the Santa Clara 
County Health Advisory Committee on Environmental Teratology and agreed 
in the spring of 1982 that enough evidence existed to start a formal 
investigation. Tapwater and wellwater testing occurred throughout the 
Peninsula. In the South Bay near Los Paseos, tapwater sampling revealed 
trace contaminants.^["Environmental News Fact Sheet: Status Report, 
South Bay Tapwater Sampling Program," November 5, 1984, Folder 14, Box 
12, {FILL} SVTC records, SJSU.]

They released the results in 1985, reaching two key 
conclusions: the neighborhood of Los Paseos experienced higher rates of 
miscarriages and a threefold increase in total birth defects compared to 
nearby communities that had no known water contamination, and the 
community experienced a two-and-a-half times higher rate of major heart 
defects compared to the rest of the county.^["State Health Department 
Reeleases Fairchild Studies," Department of Health Services *News News*, 
January 16, 1985, 1, Folder 8, Box 12, SVTC records, SJSU.] The study, 
however, made no causal link between the contamination and the high 
presence of birth defects, citing the lack of water monitoring prior to 
1981 that could provide potential data on a link between health effects 
and contaminated water. But to the anti-toxic activists, the study 
confirmed their view that contaminated water had adverse effects on the 
community.^[Lorraine Ross, "State Study Confirms Birth Defect Cluster," 
*Silicon Valley Toxics News* (April 1985): 3, Folder 3, Box 18, SVTC 
records, SJSU.]

In 1983 several Los Paseos families filed suit against Fairchild 
Semiconductor, IBM, and the Great Oaks Water Company. The case 
eventually settled in 1986 for an undisclosed amount of money for the 
530 residents involved with the suit. The companies paid a 
multimillion-dollar settlement, an amount, resident's attorney John 
Tyndall explained, that was "far more of a significant settlement in 
terms of what the people are actually getting" than the Love Canal 
lawsuit in New York.^["Pact reached in tainted-water dispute," *San Jose 
Mercury News*, July 4, 1986, Folder 8, Box 12, SVTC records, SJSU.]

Industry faced another potent challenge to their image: the neighborhood 
of Love Canal in New York. Like the toxic spill in San Jose, the 
neighborhood of Love Canal in Niagara Falls galvanized community 
activists in 1978 after decades of chemical dumping by Hooker Chemical 
led to widespread health effects in the community that included birth 
defects. The company had buried nearly 21,000 tons of chemical waste at 
the site, and the area became such a concern that the federal government 
relocated 800 families. The disaster at Love Canal led to Congress 
passing the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and 
Liability Act (CERCLA), or Superfund Act.^[@gottleib2005forcing, 
246--248; @rothman2000saving, 192--195.] In the Bay Area, activists 
pointed to Love Canal as the potential future for Silicon Valley. The 
Santa Clara County Labor Council's business manager, Peter 
Cervantes-Gautschi, observed that "we want to prevent San Jose from 
being transformed into another Love Canal."^["Big Turnout Urged in San 
Jose to Curb Toxic Contamination," *California AFL-CIO News*, January 
28, 1983, Folder 5, Box 10, SVTC records, SJSU. See also "Labor in lead 
on toxic controls," *Santa Clara County Labor*, February 11, 1983, 
Folder 5, Box 10, SVTC records, SJSU.] These concerns reflected a new 
environmentalism in California, one still grounded locally but concerned 
about issues beyond the flora and fauna of the region that remained the 
bailiwick of other Bay Area conservation movements. The Bay Area had 
become, as Hal Rothman once phrased it, a symbol of "the toxicity of 
progress."^[@rothman2000saving, 195.] What made the contamination even 
more insidious was its apparent invisibility. At Love Canal, toxic 
wastes oozed to the surface, fires spontaneously ignited during summers, 
children tossed chunks of phosphorus against the ground causing white 
sparks, and the odor was ever-persistent.^[@rothman2000saving, 192.] 
In Santa Clara County, there were no visible signs of the toxic landscape.

The State Regional Water Quality Control Board decided not to indict IBM
in its contamination, a move that outraged anti-toxics
environmentalists.

### The Tap Water Rebellion

While Lorraine Ross continued to organize her neighbors into a political 
force in San Jose, a vocal and persistent group of activists used the 
contamination of water to argue that industry and urban growth 
threatened social stability, environmental quality, and bodily health.  
What historian Carl Abbott has called "neo-Progressives," these 
activists mirrored other critiques around the urban West in the postwar 
decades.^[@abbott1995frontier, 39.] They located in the region's 
environmental, social, and economic problems the lack of structures 
present to protect city's environs. A new coalition of housewives, 
laborers, environmental activists, layers, doctors, businesspeople, and 
minorities challenged the notion that high tech industry was "clean" 
industry and came to dominate the political discussion. Significantly, 
the political discussion of the environment began to shift. The previous 
decades of environmentalists and conservationists focused on the health 
of nature; in the 1980s, a new environmental critique emerged focusing 
on environmental justice and the health of humans.

![Ted Smith, from Ted Smith, "Pioneer Activist for Environmental Justice
in Silicon Valley, 1967--2000," an oral history conducted in 2000 by Carl
Wilmsen, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University
of California, Berkeley, 2003.](figures/smith_svtc.png)

Ted Smith, a young San Jose attorney, led the way in building bridges 
between these groups. Smith's involvement in environmental issues were 
personal as well as professional. A New Yorker by birth, Smith moved to 
Washington, D.C., in the late 1960s, where he worked under President 
Lyndon Johnson's anti-poverty VISTA program for two years before moving 
to the Bay Area to earn a law degree from Stanford and start his own San 
Jose practice in 1973.^[@mahon1985chargedbodies, 252.] His experiences 
in VISTA and witnessing riots and demonstrations in the Capitol deeply 
shaped Smith's attitudes towards social justice. "I think things were so 
intense then," he recalled, "that I just haven't been able to put it out 
of my soul."^[@mahon1985chargedbodies, 261.] Smith's upbringing exposed 
him to activism and social justice. His mother was a social activist, 
involved with the League of Women Voters, the YWCA, and the World Youth 
Convention. "I think some of her experiences and sensibilities were 
passed on," he recalled.^[Ted Smith oral history, Berkeley, 2.] 
Environmental issues were not part of Smith's early political activism 
as he directed his energy into the civil rights and peace movements. But 
his work on those issues shaped his later thinking about environmental 
politics and early legal career.^[Ted Smith, oral history, Berkeley, 
4--6.] Smith began his law practice as a labor lawyer representing 
cannery workers facing racial discrimination and injuries on the job, 
but found himself drawn more and more to the Bay Area's electronic 
industry through his representation of industrial workers.  His 
conviction that industry had destroyed nature in the Bay Area was formed 
in the crucible of labor rights. Through his wife, Amanda Hawes, a legal 
services attorney and founder of the Project on Health and Safety in 
Electronics (PHASE), Smith began to connect with clients injured by 
chemical exposure inside electronics manufacturing facilities. "The 
electronics industry," Smith argued, "was actually a chemical-handling 
industry."^[Ted Smith, oral history, Berkeley, 13.] The number of 
clients coming to him with disabling injuries, illnesses, and diseases 
sparked his interest in the industry and the heavy reliance on chemicals 
in the manufacture of electronics. Smith believed working conditions and 
environmental concerns went hand-in-hand, and the discovery of the 
Fairchild leak provided him with an opportunity to tie the two together 
and raise awareness on both issues.^[Ted Smith, oral history, interview 
by Glenna Matthews, San Jose State University; @mahon1985chargedbodies, 
252–253; "Ted Smith: Foes Think He's Anti-Business, but Fans Say He's 
Earth's Advocate," *The Business Journal Magazine*, October 15, 1990,

(SCCOSH) and Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) Records,

The issue of toxics and chemical storage continued to gain attention
over the course of the year. In June, an explosion at IBM's South San
Jose plant from improperly stored aluminum waste injured eighteen
people. Hewlett-Packard reported five chemical leaks dating back at
least two years at their Palo Alto headquarters. IBM reported leaks at
their South San Jose facility dating back to 1972. Moffett Airfield's
became one of the worst contamination areas, with nineteen different
sites on the naval air base eventually identified as toxic spills. One
study by the Santa Clara Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
found that 85% of the test wells they dug tested positive for water
contamination by industrial solvents. Reports of leaks and spills became
so common that the *San Jose Mercury News* editorialized in February 1982
that "if the present pattern continues, this newspaper might have to
stop printing a separate story about each Silicon Valley hazardous
chemical leak and just run a daily box score in agate type." Almost no
part of the landscape, it seemed, remained untouched by
industry.^["Anti-spill measures still pend," *San Jose Mercury*, July 24,

Keeping the public educated and maintaining a public voice for those
affected by industrial contamination and chemical exposure became
Smith's first priority. In front of the San Jose city hall on November
4, 1982, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) announced its
establishment. In a letter circulated to community organizations and individuals, SVTC explained its purpose:

> ...we believe now is the time to pull together a coalition to further 
> organize around these issues. In recent discussions with 
> representatives from labor, health, environmental and community 
> organizations and groups, it has been clear that such a coalition is 
> not only *essential* but it is *feasible* to get off the ground in the 
> immediate future. . . . We proposed the name SILICON VALLEY TOXICS 
> COALITION, the long-term goal of which would be to maintain our 
> communities and workplaces free from toxic contamination.^["High Tech

> original. Full publication in *High Tech and Toxics*, Golden Empire 
> Planning Center, 1985, in Folder 3, Box 18, SVTC records, SJSU.]

\noindent Formed with the financial and personnel support from the
Santa Clara County Occupational Health and Safety (SCCOSH) organization,
SVTC's immediate goal was to pass a model toxic wastes ordinance
while simultaneously becoming a key voice in the
debate over chemicals in the Bay Area.^["Group fights for toxic-waste
ordinance," *Peninsula Times Tribune*, November 4, 1982, Folder 2, Box 10,
Santa Clara Center for Occupational Health (SCCOSH) and Silicon Valley
Toxics Coalition (SVTC) Records, MSS-2007--04--06, San Jose State
University Library Special Collections & Archives. PHASE renamed itself
into SCCOSH in the early 1980s.] Technology companies "still promoted
themselves as clean industry," Smith recalled. "So this was shocking
news to people here."^[Smith oral history, Matthews, 17.] As the mythos
surrounding "clean" industry collapsed, Smith was determined to keep the
pressure on industry.

What gave Smith and others a push to organize more formally---and became 
SVTC's first major campaign---was a 1982 proposal by the Santa Clara 
County Fire Chiefs' Association (SCCFCA) to set forth regulations 
regarding chemical storage and reporting leaks.^[Ted Smith, oral 
history, Matthews, 16; @mahon1985chargedbodies, 254.] Firefighters were 
first responders to chemical spills and leaks, and the Fire Chiefs' 
Association wanted to ensure that firefighters knew what they would be 
dealing with if they arrived at the scene. Along with a coalition of 
businesses and trade groups, they formed an organization called the 
Industry Environmental Coordinating Committee in the spring of 1982 to 
codify what was called the Hazardous Materials Model Code to the San 
Jose city council. The ordinance aimed to set county-wide standards for 
the storage and handling of toxic or flammable chemicals.^[Clipping, 
"Group fights for toxic-waste ordinance," *Peninsula Times Tribune*, 
November 4, 1982, Folder 2, Box 10, Santa Clara Center for Occupational 
Health (SCCOSH) and Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) Records, 
MSS-2007--04--06, San Jose State University Library Special Collections 
& Archives; Smith oral history, Berkeley, 16; "Anti-spill measures still 
pend," *San Jose Mercury News*, July 24, 1982, SVTC Records, SJSU.] The 
Hazardous Materials ordinance face stiff resistance from industry, who 
largely argued against revealing chemicals stored on their property that 
potentially threatened to reveal trade secrets. Service station owners 
also objected to some of the stipulations of the model ordinance, 
arguing that the new regulations would force smaller business to close 
as the regulation costs could not be met. But industry also faced 
a furious public and a media less predisposed to support them. The *San 
Jose Mercury News* was quick to support environmental regulatory 
measures controlling toxic chemicals.^["Danger: Hazardous Materials," 
*San Jose Mercury News*, February 3, 1982, Folder 5, Box 10, SVTC, 
SJSU.]

Despite industrial resistance, the model ordinance passed with 
widespread endorsement of the Inter-Governmental Council, a coalition of 
Bay Area city managers led by Sunnyvale manager Thomas Lewcock, San Jose 
Mayor Janet Gray Hayes, the Santa Clara County Regional Water District, 
and was quickly adopted by Peninsula cities.^["Contamination law gets

environmentalists were not completely satisifed with the passage of the 
final model ordinance. The ordinance had gone far in protecting 
employees who disclosed their employer's chemical disposal practices, 
imposed new regulations requiring double-walled storage containers and 
new leak detection systems, obtain permits from their home cities for 
chemical storage, and required companies to identify all stored 
chemicals. But a key component of the ordinance that environmentalists 
wanted was the expansion of the toxic chemicals list to 800 rather than 
the 30 defined by the Environmental Protection 
Agency.^["Intergovernmental panel endorses stiff rules to protect ground 
water," *San Jose Mercury News*, February 5, 1983, Folder 5, Box 10,

At the heart of the debate over the toxic ordinances was a public policy 
dispute about the unknown effects of high tech's industrial chemicals. 
The debate, according to Smith, addressed the question of "who should 
bear the risks of scientific uncertainty---the victims of toxic exposure 
or the manufacturers and users of toxic chemicals?"^["Voters should join 
tap water rebellion," no source, no date, Folder 6, Box 10, SVTC 
records, SJSU.]

The ordinance's adoption by several Peninsula cities had
repercussions that spread beyond the borders of the county. In July
1983, Democratic state senator Byron Sher of Palo Alto introduced
Assembly Bill 1362 to the State Legislature that sought to force
industries to meet specific requirements for the storage of chemicals,
require permits and regular inspections of storage tanks, and require
the reporting of leaks within twenty-four hours of their discovery.
Sher's bill was modeled after the county ordinance, tweaked so that it
could be applied to the entire state. The bill received widespread
support from the Sierra Club, Federated Firefighters of California,
SVTC, CBE, Health Officers Organization of California, and the
California League of Cities.^["Why We Need AB 1362," Silicon Valley

The work of the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition in helping craft and 
advocate the model toxic ordinance had shaped local, state, and federal 
law. But for Ted Smith and other toxics warriors, the work had only just 
begun. "We are the leader in this because we are the leader in 
contamination of our ground water," Smith observed. The model ordinance 
tackled one half of the problem by identifying weaknesses
