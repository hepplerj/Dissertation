It was early in December when construction workers sank their backhoe into the 
earth, making way in the dirt for a second industrial solvents storage tank 
for Fairchild Semiconductor. Digging near an existing storage tank, the 
workers noticed something about the soil that did not seem right: the 
normally deep brown of the soil had taken on a rust-colored hue. They dug 
deeper and discovered that the bottom of the old storage tank was leaking. The 
above-ground gauge that measured the volume of liquid in the tank was faulty, 
and the system normally monitored incoming chemicals had not been routinely 
checked. Sufficiently concerned about the size of the leak, the construction 
crew reported their finding to the Great Oakes Water Company, which operated 
wells nearby. The water company closed the wells immediately, but on advice 
from the state health department, neither Great Oakes nor Fairchild 
Semiconductor notified the public until after fifty days (above the 
legally-required thirty-nine days).

Tests confirmed that an industrial solvent containing 1,1,1 trichloroethane 
(TCA) had leaked from the tank and concentrated in the wells at nearly twenty 
times the permissible limit established by the Environmental Protection 
Agency. 

\thoughtbreak{Julianna Ross was only two months old} when she had her first open-heart 
surgery.^[Newspaper clipping, "Silicon Valley's Fear Over Tainted Water," *San 
Francisco Chronicle*, May 16, 1983, Carton 20, Folder 12 Hazardous Waste, 
California Tomorrow Records, MS 3641, California Historical Society.] When her 
mother, Lorraine, opened the pages of the *San Jose Mercury* on January 20, 
she saw the news: Fairchild Semiconductor, just a quarter mile from her home, 
had had an environmental catastrope. And suddenly the stories and problems all 
made sense. Neighbors had complained about the water tasting and smelling 
funny, but what could not be ignored were the four children with birth 
defects, the two miscarriages, and the one stillbirth that had taken place on 
Lorraine's block in the past three years. And her youngest child, nine months old at 
the time, faced multiple congenital heart defects.

News of Fairchild's chemical leak burst onto the scene in early 1982. Who, 
Lorraine and her neighbors wondered, permitted Fairchild to store toxic 
chemicals just feet away from public wells? Who decided what trace elements 
found in the water was safe for human consumption? Why had Fairchild and Great 
Oakes taken so long to inform the public about the TCA contamination? 

The chemicals, Lorraine and her neighbors discovered, were unregulated. No 
official requirements were in place for Fairchild to frequently check its 
storage tanks. The public was unaware of the sorts of chemicals used by 
Fairchild and other high tech manufacturers, and news of the problem only 
broke when construction workers discovered there was a problem. Investigations 
revealed that the problem was even more widespread. At least an additional 36 
leaks had occurred throughout the Bay Area, including a tetrachloroethylene 
(TCE) leak near an Intel plant that had not used the chemical since 1977.

The Bay Area's contaminated soil and water led to perhaps the most significant 
shift in environmental thought. Although many of the other leaks did not 
threaten drinking water supplies, the widespread presence of toxic leaks 
concerned many residents in the Valley. For the first time, residents 
confronted the reality of Silicon Valley's dependence on chemicals---that the 
promise of "clean" industry was not so clean after all. Stories about the 
toxic leaks, a chemical explosion at Lockheed that forced the evacuation of 
400 people from Palo Alto, the stories of workers exposed to chemicals that 
caused hair loss, respiratory problems, skin infections, and worse. Valley 
residents came to see the landscape as tainted. "I'm not anti-semiconductor 
industry," Lorraine Ross noted, "but I don't want my health adversely affected 
by their profit-making. Companies should be willing to invest a portion of 
their profit to ensure they aren't damaging the environment." Studies in 1992 
reported that 57 private and 47 public drinking wells were contaminated, and 
66 plots of land were too toxic for people to walk on. County authorities 
determined that sixty-five of the seventy-nine companies they 
investigated---including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Raytheon, NEC, AMD, Signetics, 
and many others---had contaminated the soil beneath their plants. The federal 
government eventually declared twenty-nine Superfund sites---more than any 
other county in the nation---twenty-four of which resulted from electronics 
firms.^[@pellowpark2002dreams, 75-76.]
