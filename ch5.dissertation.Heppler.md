Construction workers sunk their backhoe into the earth in an early
November morning, making way in the soil for a second underground
industrial solvents storage tank for Fairchild Semiconductor. Digging
near an existing storage tank, the workers noticed something about the
soil that did not seem right: the soil seemed exceptionally wet and had
taken on a rust-colored hue. Digging deeper they discovered a leak in
the bottom of the existing storage tank. The leak went undiscovered when
the above-ground gauge that measured the volume of liquid in the tank
failed, and the system normally monitoring incoming chemicals had not
been routinely checked. Concerned about the size of the leak, the
construction crew reported their finding to Fairchild and the Great
Oakes Water Company, which operated drinking water wells nearby that
serviced several thousand residents. The water company closed the wells
immediately. Tests confirmed that an industrial solvent containing the
carcinogen 1,1,1 trichloroethane (TCA) had leaked from the tank and
concentrated in the wells at nearly twenty times the permissible limit
established by the Environmental Protection Agency. Nearly 60,000
gallons of toxic chemicals had leaked from the tank for at least two
years.^[Newspaper clipping, "Water contaminated by leak," San Jose

/thoughtbreak{Julianne Ross was only nine months old} when she had her first 
open-heart surgery. When her mother, Lorraine, opened the pages of the San 
Jose Mercury on January 20, she saw the news: Fairchild Semiconductor, just a 
quarter mile from her home, had had an environmental catastrophe.  Suddenly, 
the neighborhood stories and problems all made sense. Her neighbors had 
complained about the water tasting and smelling funny, but worse were the four 
children with birth defects, the two miscarriages, and the one stillbirth that 
had taken place on Lorraine's block in the past three years. And her youngest 
child, nine months old at the time, faced multiple congenital heart defects. 
Lorraine Ross could not help but wonder if the leak and the health problems 
were connected.^[Newspaper clipping, "Water contaminated by leak," San Jose

News of Fairchild's chemical leak burst onto the scene in early 1982,
and parents whose children had experienced health problems wondered
about a possible link. Who, Lorraine and her neighbors asked, permitted
Fairchild to store toxic chemicals just feet away from public wells? Who
decided what trace elements found in the water was safe for human
consumption? Why had Fairchild and Great Oaks taken so long to inform
the public about the TCA contamination? The chemicals, Lorraine and her
neighbors discovered, went unregulated. No official requirements were in
place for Fairchild to frequently check its storage tanks. The public
was unaware of the sorts of chemicals used by Fairchild and other high
tech manufacturers, and news of the problem only broke when construction
workers discovered there was a problem. Investigations revealed that the
problem was even more widespread. At least an additional 36 leaks had
occurred throughout the Bay Area, including a tetrachloroethylene (TCE)
leak near an Intel plant that had not used the chemical since 1977.

The Bay Area's contaminated soil and water led to a significant shift in
environmental thought. Although many of the other leaks did not threaten
drinking water supplies, the widespread presence of toxic leaks
concerned many residents in the Valley. For the first time, residents
confronted the reality of Silicon Valley's dependence on
chemicals---that the promise of "clean" industry was not so clean after
all. Stories about the toxic leaks, a chemical explosion at Lockheed
that forced the evacuation of 400 people from Palo Alto, the stories of
workers exposed to chemicals that caused hair loss, respiratory
problems, skin infections, and worse. Valley residents came to see the
landscape as tainted. "I'm not anti-semiconductor industry," Lorraine
Ross noted, "but I don't want my health adversely affected by their
profit-making. Companies should be willing to invest a portion of their
profit to ensure they aren't damaging the environment." Studies in 1992
reported that 57 private and 47 public drinking wells were contaminated,
and 66 plots of land were too toxic for people to walk on. County
authorities determined that sixty-five of the seventy-nine companies
they investigated---including IBM, Hewlett-Packard, Raytheon, NEC, AMD,
Signetics, and many others---had contaminated the soil beneath their
plants. The federal government eventually declared twenty-nine Superfund
sites---more than any other county in the nation---twenty-four of which
resulted from electronics firms.^[@pellowpark2002dreams, 75-76.]

The presence of synthetic and industrial contaminates was a revelation
to Valley suburbanites. In earlier decades, cities had dealt with the
problem of human waste as public health officials learned how to manage
the problem. Even in San Jose, the city had learned to deal with its
problem of sewage and cannery effluence though an efficient sewer system
that could handle massive volumes of detritus. But now cities of the Bay
Area were on the front lines of widespread contamination by high tech
toxics, a situation the region was unaware and unprepared to confront.

The proximity of pollutants near suburban areas along the Peninsula
resulted as a consequence of the Bay Area's lack of residential and
industrial urban planning. Because cities thought little about the
layout of their environs, industrial facilities and warehouses
frequently turned up alongside residential developments rather than
isolated from the places where people lived. The natural boundaries of
the Peninsula---the Santa Cruz Mountains to the west and the San
Francisco Bay to the east---also kept suburban areas and industry in
close proximity to one another. The simply lacked the space to expand.
The emerging crisis broadened the coalescing environmental movement,
even among those who never considered themselves environmentalists. The
daily lived experiences of the Bay Area's suburbanites expected clean
tap water and believed that the industries near their communities were
clean and green. The toxic landscape shattered that perception.

## Murky Waters

World War II had transformed the Bay Area's watershed landscape. The two
major rivers, the Guadalupe River and the Coyote Creek, and its
tributaries were only the most visible signs of the Bay Area's water
landscape. But the focus of many turned to the hidden water---that
trapped between layers of clay and gravel beneath the surface of the
cities.

Flooding confounded those who wanted borders between the physical and
the social. The heavy winter storm in 1955 washed through Alviso, Santa
Clara, and San Jose, causing extensive damage. Asphalt, concrete, and
soil compaction only worsened runoff and amplified the problem of
flooding. City and county planners turned to technology to tame the
floods, looking primarily to the Army Corps of Engineers to fund new
channels and dikes that would funnel water safely into the Bay.
Technology, they hoped, could tame nature.

To city boosters the problem lay with the rivers themselves, not the
dramatic changes that occurred on the lands around the rivers. The
solution to the river's inadequacies could be solved by engineering.
Although floodplains had always been a frequent presence in the
flatlands of the Valley, city boosters and Army Corps engineers saw the
rivers as reformers saw them in the early 1900s---channels for moving
floodwaters away from cities. But the old river had changed.

California enacted state laws in the 1960s governing the regulation of
water.

## "Fairchild or My Child?"

In 1982, Lorraine Ross found herself becoming a community activist. In
close contact with occupational health organizations such as PHASE and
SCCOSH, she began connecting with others in Los Paseos to determine if
health problems were a widespread problem. Surveying others in her
neighborhood, she turned up a list of seventy-two people who reported
health problems and birth defects.^[Lorraine Ross, "State Study Confirms
Birth Defect Cluster," *Silicon Valley Toxics News* (April 1985), 3; "San
Jose Hearing Points Up Toxic Risks at Area Plants," *California AFL-CIO
News*, February 11, 1983.] The widespread presence of leaks in San Jose
led to what one newspaper called the "birth of an eco-tragedy."^["Birth
of an eco-tragedy" *Los Angeles Herald Examiner*, February 10, 1982.]

The link between TCA and other industrial solvents used by high tech
industries and potential health problems were unknown in 1982. The
debate over contamination and health originally coalesced around the
lack of scientific evidence to support the neighborhood's claim.

Under pressure by neighborhood activists, the county agreed to study the
potential for a link between groundwater contamination and health
problems that plagued Los Paseos.

Lorraine Ross had relocated her family to Gilroy by 1983, but she
continued to be a vocal presence in the Bay Area's anti-toxics campaign.

In 1983 several Los Paseos families filed suit against Fairchild
Semiconductor.

In 1983, as well, International Business Machine's South San Jose plant
reported a longstanding industrial solvents leak.

The State Regional Water Quality Control Board decided not to indict IBM
in its contamination, a move that outraged anti-toxics
environmentalists.

## The Tap Water Rebellion

While city and county officials continued to rely on technology to save nature 
in the cities, a vocal and persistent group of activists used the 
contamination of water to argue that industry and urban growth threatened 
social stability, environmental quality, and bodily health.  What historian 
Carl Abbott has called "neo-Progressives," these activists mirrored other 
critiques around the urban West in the postwar decades.^[@abbott1995frontier, 
39.] They located in the region's environmental, social, and economic problems 
the lack of structures present to protect city's environs. A new coalition of 
housewives, laborers, environmental activists, layers, doctors, 
businesspeople, and minorities challenged the notion that high tech industry 
was "clean" industry and came to dominate the political discussion.

in Silicon Valley, 1967-2000," an oral history conducted in 2000 by Carl
Wilmsen, Regional Oral History Office, The Bancroft Library, University
of California, Berkeley, 2003.](figures/smith_svtc.png)

Ted Smith, a young San Jose attorney, led the way in building bridges
between these groups. Smith's involvement in environmental issues were
personal as well as professional. A New Yorker by birth, Smith moved to
Washington, D.C., in the late 1960s, where he worked under President
Lyndon Johnson's anti-poverty VISTA program before moving to the Bay
Area to earn a law degree from Stanford and start his own San Jose
practice in 1973.^[@mahon1985chargedbodies, 252.]
His experiences in VISTA and witnessing riots and demonstrations in the
Capitol deeply shaped Smith's attitudes towards social justice. "I think
things were so intense then," he recalled, "that I just haven't been
able to put it out of my soul."^[@mahon1985chargedbodies, 261.] Smith's
upbringing exposed him to activism and social justice. His mother was a
social activist, involved with the League of Women Voters, the YWCA, and
the World Youth Convention. "I think some of her experiences and
sensibilities were passed on," he recalled.^[Ted Smith oral history,
Berkeley, 2.] Environmental issues were not part of Smith's early
political activism as he directed his energy into the civil rights and
peace movements. But his work on those issues shaped his later thinking
about environmental politics and early legal career.^[Ted Smith, oral
history, Berkeley, 4-6.] Smith began his law practice as a labor lawyer
representing cannery workers facing racial discrimination and injuries
on the job, but found himself drawn more and more to the Bay Area's
electronic industry through his representation of industrial workers.
His conviction that industry had destroyed nature in the Bay Area was
formed in the crucible of labor rights. Through his wife, Amanda Hawes,
a legal services attorney and founder of the Project on Health and
Safety in Electronics (PHASE), Smith began to connect with clients
injured by chemical exposure inside electronics manufacturing
facilities. "The electronics industry," Smith said, "was actually a
chemical-handling industry."^[Ted Smith, oral history, Berkeley, 13.]
The number of clients coming to him with disabling injuries, illnesses,
and diseases sparked his interest in the industry and the heavy reliance
on chemicals in the manufacture of electronics. Smith believed working
conditions and environmental concerns went hand-in-hand, and the
discovery of the Fairchild leak provided him with an opportunity to tie
the two together and raise awareness on both issues.^[Ted Smith, oral
history, interview by Glenna Matthews, San Jose State University; 
@mahon1985chargedbodies, 252–253; "Ted Smith: Foes Think He's Anti-Business, but
Fans Say He's Earth's Advocate," *The Business Journal Magazine*, October

Health (SCCOSH) and Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) Records,

The issue of toxics and chemical storage continued to gain attention
over the course of the year. In June, an explosion at IBM's South San
Jose plant from improperly stored aluminum waste injured eighteen
people. Hewlett-Packard reported five chemical leaks dating back at
least two years at their Palo Alto headquarters. IBM reported leaks at
their South San Jose facility dating back to 1972. Moffett Airfield's
became one of the worst contamination areas, with nineteen different
sites on the naval air base eventually identified as toxic spills. One
study by the Santa Clara Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB)
found that 85% of the test wells they dug tested positive for water
contamination by industrial solvents. Reports of leaks and spills became
so common that the San Jose Mercury News editorialized in February 1982
that "if the present pattern continues, this newspaper might have to
stop printing a separate story about each Silicon Valley hazardous
chemical leak and just run a daily box score in agate type." Almost no
part of the landscape, it seemed, remained untouched by
industry.^["Anti-spill measures still pend," *San Jose Mercury*, July 24,

Keeping the public educated and maintaining a public voice for those
affected by industrial contamination and chemical exposure became
Smith's first priority. In front of the San Jose city hall on November
4, 1982, the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) announced its
establishment. Formed with the financial and personnel support from the
Santa Clara County Occupational Health and Safety (SCCOSH) organization,
SVTC's immediate goal was to pass the model toxic wastes ordinance
developed by the SCCFCA while simultaneously becoming a key voice in the
debate over chemicals in the Bay Area.^["Group fights for toxic-waste
ordinance," *Peninsula Times Tribune*, November 4, 1982, Folder 2, Box 10,
Santa Clara Center for Occupational Health (SCCOSH) and Silicon Valley
Toxics Coalition (SVTC) Records, MSS-2007-04-06, San Jose State
University Library Special Collections & Archives. PHASE renamed itself
into SCCOSH in the early 1980s.] Technology companies "still promoted
themselves as clean industry," Smith recalled. "So this was shocking
news to people here."^[Smith oral history, Matthews, 17.] As the mythos
surrounding "clean" industry collapsed, Smith was determined to keep the
pressure on industry.

What gave Smith and others a push to organize more formally---and became
SVTC's first major campaign---was a 1982 proposal by the Santa Clara
County Fire Chiefs' Association (SCCFCA) to set forth regulations
regarding chemical storage and reporting leaks.^[Ted Smith, oral
history, Matthews, 16; @mahon1985chargedbodies, 254.] Firefighters were
first responders to chemical spills and leaks, and the Fire Chiefs'
Association wanted to ensure that firefighters knew what they would be
dealing with if they arrived at the scene. Along with a coalition of
businesses and trade groups, they formed an organization called the
Industry Environmental Coordinating Committee in the spring of 1982 to
codify what was called the Hazardous Materials Model Code to the San
Jose city council. The ordinance aimed to set county-wide standards for
the storage and handling of toxic or flammable chemicals.^[Clipping,
"Group fights for toxic-waste ordinance," *Peninsula Times Tribune*,
November 4, 1982, Folder 2, Box 10, Santa Clara Center for Occupational
Health (SCCOSH) and Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) Records,
MSS-2007-04-06, San Jose State University Library Special Collections &
Archives; Smith oral history, Berkeley, 16.] The Hazardous Materials
ordinance face stiff resistance from industry. But industry also faced a
furious public and a media less predisposed to support them. Media was
quick to support environmental regulatory measures controlling toxic
chemicals.^["Danger: Hazardous Materials," *San Jose Mercury News*,
February 3, 1982, Folder 5, Box 10, SVTC, SJSU.]

Despite resistance, the model ordinance passed and was quickly adopted
by Peninsula cities.

But the ordinance's adoption by several Peninsula cities had
repercussions that spread beyond the borders of the county. In July
1983, Democratic state senator Byron Sher of Palo Alto introduced
Assembly Bill 1362 to the State Legislature that sought to force
industries to meet specific requirements for the storage of chemicals,
require permits and regular inspections of storage tanks, and require
the reporting of leaks within twenty-four hours of their discovery.
Sher's bill was modeled after the county ordinance, tweaked so that it
could be applied to the entire state. The bill received widespread
support from the Sierra Club, Federated Firefighters of California,
SVTC, CBE, Health Officers Organization of California, and the
California League of Cities.^["Why We Need AB 1362," Silicon Valley
Toxics Coalition mailer, July 25, 1983, Folder 2, Box 10, Santa Clara
