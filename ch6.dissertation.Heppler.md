\begin{aquote}{Janet Gray Hayes}
Political process can be used in a positive way. Cities can't solve urban problems on their own. Governments can't solve urban problems on their own. Governmental policies and programs should set the stage for private initiative and innovation. Both the public and the private sectors have an obligation for tomorrow. We need less conflict and confrontation, and more cooperation and coordination.

"We were going to have a city of 60,000 people in the hills [above Palo Alto]," Lennie Roberts recalled years after the founding of the Committee for Green Foothills. "And a number of people got together and decided, well, we'll be for something---we'll be for the Green Foothills."[^76] As the political efforts of California Tomorrow and People for Open Space accelerated, primarily in northern counties and East Bay communities like Napa and Marin, further south on the Midpeninsula ideas about restricting urban growth and critiquing environmental degradation influenced local politics. The legislative efforts of California Tomorrow and People for Open Space failed to gain much traction at the state level by the end of the 1960s, but the advocates of urban development for the sake of "progress" would find their greatest challengers coming out of grassroots politics and local action.

In Palo Alto, the Committee for Green Foothills initiated a campaign shortly after their first fight with Stanford University to enact policies for setting aside lands for recreation. Members of the Committee worked closely with the county in establishing the Midpeninsula Regional Open Space District (MROSD). In 1972, a referendum placed Measure R onto the ballot that would establish the Open Space District, originally focused on the northwestern portion of Santa Clara County. Inspired by the San Francisco-based Livingston and Blayney planning agency report in 1971 that concluded it would be cheaper for open space to be acquired and preserved rather than infrastructure extended into the foothills, the Committee for Green Foothills cited the report as a means for passing the MROSD measure.[^77] Since MROSD existed as a special district, it required no legislative intervention by the state---only the approval of county voters.[^78]

Perhaps no place better represented the shifting philosophy of growth-as-progress better than San Jose. Challenges to San Jose's growth interests on the city council began to mount in the early 1960s as homeowners in the suburban fringes of the city began opposing the city's sprawl. In 1962, Virginia Shaffer, a Republican and the first woman to be voted onto San Jose's city council, rose to office representing the interests of homeowners and taxpayers.[^79] The *Mercury News* referred to Shaffer as "Mrs. No" based on a voting record that frequently opposed rezoning decisions. Shaffer represented the expression of new interests guiding ideas about the city's future growth, but to call her platform conservation would misrepresent her attitude towards urban growth. Although her criticisms of San Jose found sympathy among conservationists, her concerns revolved primarily around slowing growth to ease the tax burden on homeowners and limiting government spending. Shaffer and her homeowner constituency had grown frustrated by the city's continual emphasis on growth without paying mind to the adequacy of city services, high taxes, and development policies that allowed construction on landslide-prone hillsides and floodplains.[^80] The 1962 elections rattled the pro-growth advocates in San Jose. "The election of 1962 cast a shadow that falls across our political scene even today," recalled former councilman and mayor George Starbird. The pro-growth council still had an ally in Dutch Hamann, who voters retained as city manager in 1962, but homeowners would be watching the council closely in their decisions about zoning, recreation, taxes, and annexations.[^81]

Growth interests in San Jose continued to influence the city's sprawling development until 1969 when antigrowth sentiment and a growing awareness of environmentalism led voters to elect the city's first environmentalist candidates. Hamann, sensing the shift in voter attitude, resigned shortly after and was replaced by a new manager, Thomas Fletcher, in 1970. Annexations declined sharply after 1970 as the city council moved its focus instead to urban renewal projects and in-fill of the city's existing boundaries. "The voices of the builders and doers became lost in the many-voiced demands of the users," Starbird lamented. "The veto was back."[^82] The end of growth-as-progress spelled disaster for city boosters by the end of the 1960s.

San Jose was among a wave of no-growth and slow-growth regulations in the Bay Area. Although San Jose's growth control measures never became quite as strident as those pursued in the northern peninsula cities of Menlo Park, Los Altos Hills, Palo Alto, and Atherton, homeowners demanded new policies to protect their natural views and aesthetics. Following the nation-wide trend in establishing land use controls to slow urban growth, only a single Bay Area town had growth control laws in 1972 but by 1975 thirty-one had established new regulations.[^83] These regulations sought to preserve a suburban and rural character of middle-class neighborhoods. For some municipalities on the Peninsula, environmental protections emerged not out of genuine concern for the environment but as a method for preserving property values or setting down symbolic boundaries between race and class. In other towns, environmental regulations did reflect a concern for the environment. Whereas San Jose politics in the 1950s sought to become the "Los Angeles of the North," in Dutch Hamann's words, the San Jose of the 1970s jettisoned its L.A. envy. "People in San Jose want limited growth," future Mayor Janet Gray Hayes remarked in 1978. "They don't want another Los Angeles."[^84] The changing contours of San Jose's green political culture grappled with two decades of unrestrained urban growth, leading voters to support new local regulations and support local political leaders that made the environment a key component of their platform.

One method of growth control came in the form of zoning for residential density. San Jose reduced residential density throughout the city from twelve to eighteen housing units per acre to six to eight units. New policies also required that no new development could be permitted until developers submitted environmental impact statements that specified how they would handle storm runoff, maintain open space, ensure the availability of city infrastructure, and accessible schools.[^85] In 1973, San Jose voters passed Measure B that prevented new residential development until adequate school space was provided for future residents.[^86] Many of these regulations, however, had the unintended affect of offloading the costs of development and environmental regulations onto consumers, and made low- and mid-size developments unprofitable for most developers. In response, developers built pricier housing affordable only to high-income residents.[^87] Various maneuvers to build low-income housing in Los Altos Hills, San Jose, and elsewhere in Silicon Valley faced challenges by conservationists who complained that such projects threatened environmental land use regulations.

Concerns about the environmental impact of the region's rapid growth moved to the forefront of electoral politics in the early 1970s. Among the most influential critics of sprawl was Janet Gray Hayes. A native of Indiana who came to San Jose in 1956, Hayes involved herself in local politics almost immediately, becoming a key member of the League of Women Voters and president of the organization. In 1966, Governor Pat Brown nominated Hayes to the state's Redevelopment Board and, in 1971, she held her first political office by winning a seat on the San Jose city council. Hayes narrowly won the 1974 mayoral race against former police officer Bart Collins to fill a seat vacated by Norman Mineta, who voters sent to Congress. Hayes was the first woman to serve as mayor of a major metropolitan center and among a wave of female political leaders taking office in Santa Clara County. San Jose was quickly given the distinction of "feminist capital of the world" as female political leaders assumed positions of power throughout city and county government.[^88] Hayes ran on a platform of responsible growth and environmental consciousness, epitomized by her campaign promise to "make San Jose better before we make it bigger."

Hayes meshed well with the growing concerns of San Jose voters. Many had become increasingly suspicious of urban growth and its synonym of progress. In one survey, voters identified open space, urban growth, and the environment as key challenges facing the city. Among their top concerns, voters identified pollution, overpopulation, land use planning and zoning, and parks and recreation as major concerns leading up to the 1974 mayoral elections.[^89] Sixty-six percent of the survey's respondents listed protecting the environment as the top task the city needed to take on, and fifty-nine percent felt that curbing growth and protecting open space was necessary.[^90] Many city council members began to distance themselves from real estate interests in the city, identifying an association with developers as a political liability.[^91] San Jose had become a popular symbol of poor urban growth, lambasted by popular media, books, and studies.[^92] Residents wanted that image---and reality---corrected.

Controlling urban growth became a feature of Valley politics stemming from desire among homeowners to preserve their aesthetic views, one of the very amenities that drew newcomers to suburbs throughout the Bay Area. In 1970, City Manager Fletcher hired Rand researchers to study the ways San Jose could curtail growth. The researchers concluded little could be done by the city. While city leaders accommodated to the demands of developers, the drivers of urban growth were external---federal investments into suburban homeownership, the decentralization of industry, and highway construction created a situation where Santa Clara County followed similar urban trends throughout the country.[^93] But land use regulations were popular among homeowners because it promised protections of aesthetic vistas. The Rand researchers noted a "growing concern for the natural environment and continued concern for one's family environment." Many homeowners found "their fortunes are tied, not to continued growth . . . , but to keeping out those who would move in to change the area further and who, by virtue of moving in, would destroy the reasons for which those who are already in the County moved there."[^94] Whether avowed environmentalists or not, homeowners saw the protection of their environments as a key component of their suburban lifestyles.[^95]

Against the backdrop of skepticism towards developers and frustrations with urban growth, the 1978 San Jose mayoral campaign centered almost exclusively around limiting urban growth, what the *San Francisco Chronicle* simply called "The Issue."[^96] Hayes, who had risen to prominence on the basis of her commitment to controlling sprawl in San Jose, was challenged by city council member Al Garza. A native of East San Jose who worked as a school teacher and administrator, Garza was appointed to the council to fill a seat vacated by the death of Vice Mayor Kurt Gross in 1971. He successfully ran for reelection in 1973 and 1976. Garza took aim at Hayes' campaign promises of "better before bigger," in particular accusing the city's lack of attention in providing East Side with the "services and amenities" of the rest of the city.[^97]

Debates around the two candidates positions focused on specific spaces in the city. Hayes insisted early in the campaign that she was a limited growth---not anti-growth---candidate, while Garza represented pro-growth interests in the city. Hayes pointed to her support to various plans included attracting new industry, using a policy of fill-in to build in areas already adequately served by city services, an expansion of city parks, and capital improvements. Garza pointed to other areas of the city, such as Hayes' approval of a commercial development in the Evergreen district in southeast San Jose where existing roads could not handle the influx of traffic.[^98] Yet even the pro-growth sympathies of the *San Jose Mercury* evaporated by the mid-1970s. The *Mercury* editorialized in support of reelecting Hayes, arguing that her policy of in-filling, improving the city tax base, promoting urban redevelopment, and cutting government spending had served to control growth and take advantage of existing city services.[^99]

A strong anti-incumbent sensibility among San Jose voters contributed to a runoff election between Hayes and Garza after neither managed to gain a majority vote in the June primaries. The political interest in land use bled into other city and county campaigns, primarily the Santa Clara County supervisor seat vacated by the retirement of Sig Sanchez. A runoff between Susanne Wilson, a city council member, and Ivan Zubow, a South County land developer who funded his campaign out of his own pockets, exposed political faultlines around growth. Wilson emphasized her voting record of slow growth, while Zubov charged that her record failed to reflect her claim. Zubow argued his role as a land developer made him more than qualified for the position.[^100]

Builders and developers were central figures in the campaign. The Hayes-Garza race achieved prominence as the most expensive campaign waged in San Jose's history, supported largely by developer interests that poured money into both candidates. The Builders and Contractors Committee, comprised of thirty members of builders, contractors, bankers, and associated industries, pledged \$14,000 to Garza's campaign and planned donations of \$10,000 to Councilman Joe Colla, who faced a challenge from limited growth advocate Jerry Estruth. Bill Williams, a member of the Committee and builder for Sea Homes, remarked that he could "only surmise that the majority of our members felt that those two people [Garza and Colla] are better for our industry."[^101] By the end of the mayoral campaign, sixty percent of Garza's political donations came from developers.[^102] Hayes, Garza, Estruth, Colla, Zubow, and Wilson all received major contributions from local developers.[^103]

![The perceived cozy relationship between pro-growth members of the San
Jose city council and developers caught the ire of
voters.](figures/garza-colla-cartoon.png)

The mayoral campaign became mired in controversy as it entered the final three months. In a maneuver that rhymed with the Progress Committee's firing of the city manager in the 1940s, the pro-growth contingency on the city council sought to strike at the Hayes campaign by orchestrating an ouster of City Manager Ted Tedesco. Tedesco assumed office in 1973 and had guided San Jose's in-fill policy. In a four-to-three vote, the city council voted to remove Tedesco from his position. The council members opposing Tedesco---Garza, David Runyon, a real estate developer, Joe Colla, a drugstore owner known for being a maverick, and Larry Pegram, the council's only Republican---overruled the votes of Hayes, Wilson, and Jim Self. Local media quickly dubbed the pro-growth members the "Fearsome Foursome." The opponents of Tedesco were open about their reasoning. Garza explained that Tedesco's ouster reflected his unwillingness to serve the will of the council majority, suggesting that the city manager's slow-growth sensibilities had gotten in the way of the city's operation.[^104] Joe Colla reasoned frankly: "He was anti-growth, and this is now a pro-growth city."[^105] In the midst of the Tedesco ouster, the Fearsome Foursome also pushed through additional pro-growth policies including the abolishment of a city policy tying new growth to adequate streets, adopting a \$28 million road program to build new roads rather than improve existing infrastructure, and approved a new tax on urban development days before Proposition 13 made it illegal.[^106]

In November, the pro-growth outlook of the Fearsome Foursome failed to resonate with voters. Hayes swept past Garza, who claimed over 70% of the vote, while Colla was unseated from the council by Estruth, who received 60% of the vote. Shortly after the campaigns, David Runyon was forced to resign after a public drinking scandal and was replaced by Tom McEnery, another limited-growth advocate.[^107] The public rejection of Garza and the pro-growth interests in the city council reflected the political shift happening throughout California and the West as concerns about growth and the environment shaped the region's politics. Jubilant victors and outside observers saw Hayes' victory as a sign that the city's incessant drive for expansion had come to an end. Hayes herself saw her victory as "a clear mandate" that San Joseans were through with the growth-as-progress philosophy.[^108]

Just as voters helped enable urban growth through their sanction of municipal bonds in the 1950s and 1960s coupled with their desire for countryside living, so to did people begin to have second thoughts about such growth. Inadequate city services, high taxes, gridlocked roads, environmental damage, and a sense that quality of life was declining contributed to a state of alarm and calls for reform. Voters were motivated to action through various sentiments. Sometimes these reflected genuine ecological concerns, arrived at through their exposure to expert literature. Other times, responses to growth came in the form of quality-of-life concerns and a loss of aesthetics, a concern that the foothills of the Santa Cruz and Diablo ranges would be filled with homes or obscured by daily smog. They frequently tied economic issues to environmental issues. Citing the Marshall Plan, urban redevelopment, and the moon landings, Dorothy Erskine pleaded with Michael McCloskey to find out how "can we make environmental protection fit this pattern and perhaps save us from war and a worse fate?"[^109] The political contests over sprawl and growth highlighted how ecological, economic, and social issues intertwined in postwar Santa Clara County. The cities had managed to co-opt regional government, but in the process sparked a grassroots protest. They enjoyed the amenities of the Peninsula, and when those were threatened they pushed for reform.[^110]

Yet while Hayes and her supporters appeared to have achieved victory over the growth-is-progress ideology that had dominated San Jose politics since the 1940s---and most local politics for several municipalities in Santa Clara County---the case for reform did not always mean more effective government. Slow-growth interests succeeded in slowing growth, including the San Jose city council's approval of a 1976 General Plan that was seen as a bridle on growth, development moratoriums throughout the Peninsula, and successful efforts and shutting down proposed residential developments.[^111] Yet local governments remained at odds with one another. Despite maneuvers by San Jose to preserve foothills from residential development, for example, proposals by Santa Clara County planners sought to open up hillsides in the Santa Cruz and Diablo mountains for residential development. Environmentalists decried the threats of earthquakes, landslides, and sewer systems that could threaten mountain reservoirs, yet to county planners the decision to open up lands for construction only helped to reduce pressure for more development.[^112] The county's plans were all the more troubling to environmentalists following an amended 1980 county General Plan that loosened the slope-density formula that restricted the number of subdivisions that could appear in a 100-acre lot with an average slope of twenty degrees. To the editors of the *San Jose Mercury*, county planners lacked "political will." [^113]

Developers no longer ruled the Valley's future. In November 1982, developer Lee Brandenburg won the approval of the San Jose city council to begin construction on a hillside development, the first such development in the city since 1976. Brandenburg had built housing developments throughout the South Bay in Saratoga, Los Gatos, Almaden, Willow Glen, and West San Jose.[^114] Brandenburg saw himself adding to San Jose's cultural and economic capital. Casting himself as an environmentalist and lifelong member of the Nature Conservancy, Brandenburg assured the council and critics at a public hearing that he submitted careful studies of Urban Service Area expansion, archaeological reports, geological and seismic investigations, engineering analysis, and traffic analysis to ensure the development would not become a burden upon the city or its residents. Furthermore, Brandenburg argued, just as he had when one of his proposals came before the city council in 1978, that such high-end developments would attract wealthy and powerful residents, many of whom "do business in San Jose [but] don't live there."[^115] Located north of Silver Creek in the southeast end of the city, the Silver Creek Hills development sought to be a resort complete with an Arnold Palmer-designed golf course, resort hotel, shops, and 2,610 luxury homes and condominiums. The League of Women Voters and an ad hoc coalition calling themselves San Joseans for Limited Growth filed suit against the city council, arguing that the city failed to follow state environmental laws and, therefore, their approval to amend the General Plan for the Brandenburg development was illegal. Nor, they argued, could the sustainability of the planned community be assured. Not only would Silver Creek Hills reside on extremely steep hillsides, argued H.G. Wilshire, a member of the Committee for Green Foothills, but construction would disturb "underlain . . . rocks that are notoriously difficult to stabilize." The threats of landslides and unsuitability of city services to reach the community, Wilshire concluded, reflected "risk-taking with innocent lives" by the city council.[^116] In the end, a county judge overruled the council's approval. The environmentalists had won.

\thoughtbreak{Shortly after her election} as mayor, Janet Gray Hayes spoke before an audience at the Conference on Bay Area Urban Growth held in San Francisco. Growth management, Hayes posited, was defined by the three "Ps"---"piecemeal, patchwork, and prop-up." Her message that day was the role of politics and cities. "Political process can be used in a positive way," she told the audience. "Cities can't solve urban problems on their own. Government's can solve urban problems on their own. Governmental policies and programs should set the stage for private initiative and innovation. Both the public and the private sectors have an obligation for tomorrow. We need less conflict and confrontation, and more cooperation and coordination."[^117] By the end of the 1980s, cities throughout the Peninsula had placed development limits into their urban plans. Local governments responded to the demands of grassroots activists who expected more from their political leaders. Local opposition to boosters owed much to the new environmental regulations and environmentalists. Plans to expand cities further into the foothills drew attention of environmental organizations whose efforts shaped the proposals. Yet even as environmentalists had halted new development, it could not reverse the original land grab. Once the political ability to confront powerful growth interests became viable, the geography of the postindustrial space had already been set. Capital was fixed in space, shaping suburban and industrial spaces that introduced uneven impacts on housing and environmental risk. The consequences of that history would become apparent in the 1980s, as the following chapter explores, when the landscape of industry and the landscape of suburbs collided over the pollution of space.
