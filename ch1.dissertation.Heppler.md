What is Silicon Valley? 

The very question conjures images of iPhones, computers, Steve Jobs, maybe erroneously, Microsoft. This Silicon Valley is a set of assumptions and attitudes defined by technology, invention, innovation, venture funding, and capital.  

But Silicon Valley is also a place. Few people, when asked about Silicon Valley, would answer that it's the Santa Clara Valley of northern California. Even those who live in the Valley are more likely to think of the place not as a *place*, but as an *ideal*, a philosophy.

\thoughtbreak{The story starts with land}.

In 1951, Stanford University founded the Stanford Industrial Park, a visionary land development that sought to attract electronics manufacturers and researchers to the Midpeninsula. Perhaps no place more embodied mid-twentieth century politics than the Bay Area: a place of optimism, defined by its connections to the Cold War military-industrial complex, proud of its patriotism and contribution to anticommunism. In the years after World War II, millions of migrants established new homes in northern California to take jobs in high technology, defense, biomedical, professional, and service industries. Single-family homes sprouted across the California landscape for families and their children in one of the largest demographic shifts in American history. They came for jobs, for opportunities, for beautiful landscape, and for climate. The Santa Clara Valley, after all, was "God's favorite valley."^[Quotes from Tsu, *Garden of the World*, 3-4. *Picturesque San Jose and Environments: An Illustrated Statement of the Progress, Prosperity, and Resources of Santa Clara County, California* (San Jose: H. S. Foote and C. A. Woolfolk, 1893), n.p.; *The Progressive City Beautiful: Santa Clara* (Santa Clara Chamber of Commerce, n.d.); E. Alexander Powell, "The Valley of Heart's Delight," *Sunset* 29 (August 1912), 120.] The suburban Midpeninsula not only became home to what would become a massive economic sector and homes for thousands of Americans, but stood at the center of a powerful grassroots political movement. An invigorated environmental politics---fueled by the loss of open space, damaged wilderness areas, rampant suburban sprawl, and environmental disasters---burst onto the scene in the 1960s. Santa Clara Valley stood at the center of the new political impulse. Residents around backyard barbecues, around kitchen tables, and inside community clubs formed coalitions to champion ecological stewardship and raise environmental awareness. In so doing, they became significant voices in local, state, and national politics and stood at the forefront of a growing political environmental movement. But before that story begins, we must set the scene: the Santa Clara Valley and its history, political and cultural heritage, its economic development, and agricultural past. 

The Bay Area shed its agricultural past and embraced its post-industrial suburban future following World War II. In 1949, the City of Santa Clara published a brochure boasting itself "known as the Prune Center of the World." Fifteen years later, Santa Clara issued a new pamphlet that made no mention of trees or fruit. Instead, the city promoted itself as "Geared for Growth."^[Cavin, "Citizenship," 230.] Between 1944 and 1962, businesses invested $290 million in new industrial plants that made Santa Clara County "the industrial colossus of the Bay Area." The pamphlet emphasized the vast amounts of land available for industry, research, and development. In boasting about it's water infrastructure, the city meant not water for crops but manufacturing processes, industrial effluent, and sewage. "We in Santa Clara," Howard Kingston, president of the Chamber, stated, "have created an atmosphere for industry that is designed to help each and every firm tell a profit story."^[Santa Clara Chamber of Commerce, "Industrial Introduction to the City of Santa Clara," 1964.] The Valley's agricultural history fostered an imagined environment and a historical reality. Culture and nature intertwined, shaping the philosophy of the Valley's mid-century environmentalists. As the landscape shifted and orchards were carved away to support suburbs and industry. The landscape that emerged in the Valley in the mid- to late-nineteenth century was human-created, a landscape of orchards, farmlands, and ranching that generated perceptions of "natural" that would be lost in the face of urban development. This "natural" landscape would be looked upon nostalgically as the Bay Area's new high technology economy began to reshape the landscape.

\thoughtbreak{The story begins with the land}. As the Wisconsin glaciation period was ending 12,000 years ago, uplift resulting from the collision of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates started shaping the San Francisco Bay Area into its present form. The collision forced the coastline northward along the San Andreas fault, causing additional uplift along the entire coast that generated the coastal range. The new coastal ranges interrupted the flow of air coming off the Pacific Ocean. At the northern end of the Bay, a stubborn marine layer created by regular temperature inversions that tended to trap cool, moist air causing regular fog to drift into the mouth of the Bay. On the Pacific-facing site of the coastal ranges, the cool, moist air allowed coastal redwoods to flourish that gives the Santa Cruz Mountains its green vale year-round. Yet the range also produced a rain shadow for the flatlands of the Valley, where trees became scarce and grasses took their place. Hence, the eastern Diablo Range remains dry and khaki brown during most of the year except during the rainy season. The coastal ranges protected the Valley from serious frosts, major storms, and excessive temperatures, giving the region it's reputation as one of the most temperate environments on the planet.^[@mars1901reminiscences, 76; @friedly2000eden, {PG}.]

Grossinger et al., "Historical Landscape Ecology of an Urbanized California Valley: Wetlands and Woodlands in the Santa Clara Valley," *Landscape Ecology* 22 (December 2007): 112.](figures/landcover.png) 

The uplift of the coastal range reshaped the flow of water. At the time the glacial period ended, a single river flowed across what would become the Santa Clara Valley, meeting with the Sacramento River to the east and flowing to the lowest point along the Coast Range. Although glaciers never reached coastal California, the changing global climate reshaped the region's ecology. The melting glaciers increased sea levels that flooded the majority of ancient valleys, creating the San Francisco Bay. Uplift allowed new trickles of water to slowly carve paths into the landscape. Most river channels were shallow and narrow, prone to flooding. Most mountain run-off dissipated quickly into the well--drained alluvial soils and replenished underground aquifers. Freshwater marshes, seasonally--flooded meadows, forested wetlands, and riparian habitats were common natural features on the Valley landscape. Nearly 5,000 years ago, the landscape of the present Bay Area had largely taken shape.^[@friedly2000eden, 18.]

Below ground, the Valley was supplied by a regional aquifer that consisted of multiple Pleistocene aquifers grouped into upper and lower systems. These groundwater systems were replenished primarily through precipitation, stream channels, and, today, artificial recharge ponds. The presence of rock faults also served as potential sources and barriers of hydrological flows. The Valley had few rivers coursing through it. Twenty--six major creeks flowed through the Valley, and the major rivers included the Arroyo Hondo, Guadalupe River, and Pajaro River, which originated in the Santa Cruz or Diablo Range and emptied into the Calaveras Reservoir, the San Francisco Bay, and the Pacific Ocean respectively. A majority of the thirty--seven lakes now in the Bay Area are artificial or serve as man-made reservoirs. Two major dam projects, the Coyote Dam built in 1936 and the Anderson Dam built in 1950, began regulating watershed discharge. Recent changes in vegetation and habitats came about due to changes in stream hydrology that included flood control efforts and summer water releases from groundwater recharge associated with the Coyote and Anderson dams.

The interactions of wind, air, and land shaped the layout of the Santa Clara Valley. Between the Santa Cruz and Diablo ranges, the Valley widens out from 15 miles across at its northern point near the mouth of the San Francisco Bay to 25 miles across at its southern end before the Diablo and Santa Cruz mountains nearly converge to form the Coyote Narrows. Within these lands, the Valley hosted a variety of lifeforms. Along the Valley floor, oak scrub, cacti, and a variety of oak, willow, sycamore, and alder trees provided cover for wildlife and shelters for native grasses. At higher elevations, a variety of conifers including coastal redwoods (*Sequoia sempervirens*), ponderosa pine (*pinus ponderosa*), sugar pine (*pinus lambertiana*) mingled with white fir (*Abies concolor*) and black oak (*Quercus kelloggii*) that carpeted the mountains in green. The plants of the Valley adapted to the Mediterranean climate: perennial bunchgrasses die back every winter, leaving only roots to help preserve water; oak trees have extensive root systems to tap into groundwater supplies.^[Friedly, "This Brief Eden," 20.] The oak woodlands and chaparral ecoregions provided habitats for acton woodpeckers, nuthatch, oak titmouse, and Pacific pallid bats. Major waterways supported a diverse range of native fish species, including Pacific lamprey (*Lampetra tridentata*), steelhead trout, chinook salmon, Sacramento blackfish, and tule perch, among many others. Golden beavers and raccoons shared the landscape with rabbits, squirrels, and other small species, as well as a variety of snakes, lizards, spiders, and insects. Mountain lions, wolves, and grizzly bears once hunted and lived in the valley, mingling with ungulates such as elk and mule deer. Woodpeckers, wrentits, scrub jays, Chestnut-backed Chickadees, and hundreds of additional bird species thrived in the Valley's skies.

The Santa Clara Valley is home to one of the most temperate environments on the planet, and its habitability for humans informed its historical development. From the beginning of human habitation, nature and human culture were intertwined.

\thoughtbreak{The land and the bay were important} environmental and cultural features to many people. The Ohlone people, Penutian-speakers that included the Miwok, Wintun, Maidu, and Yokuts who likely migrated to the Santa Clara Valley from the eastern foothills of the Central Valley around 6,000 years ago, displaced or assimilated Hokan-speaking populations already living in the area. When Spanish colonists arrived in the Valley, Ohlone numbered between 7,000 and 26,000. They subsisted on the land by collecting acorns from oak trees, hunted game, fished, and harvested clams and other shellfish from the Bay. The discarded shells formed the famous shellmounds along the Bay's shores.^[For a map of the shellmound locations, see Matthew Booker and Allen Roberts, *Shellmounds in San Francisco Bay Area, 1909*, Spatial History Project, Stanford University, <https://web.stanford.edu/group/spatialhistory/cgi-bin/site/viz.php?id=23>.] Disease and warfare allowed Spanish settlers to overwhelm Ohlone communities. In the fifty years between the arrival of Spanish missionaries and the end of Spanish rule in 1821, Native populations declined by seventy-five percent in the Bay Area.^[@booker2012tide, {PG}; Milliken, *Time of Little Choice*; Rawls, *Indians of California*, 13--21; Hurtado, *Indian Survival on the California Frontier*.] 

When Spanish colonial settlers first crested the Santa Cruz Mountains in the late-1760s, they saw a Valley hosting a range of ecosystems---coastal redwoods and Douglas fir dominated the ridge of the mountain, giving way to chaparrel shrub that occupied the rockier soils in the foothills. As the foothills smoothed out into the flatlands of the valley, grasslands overtook the chaparrel and were dotted with oak savannahs, cottonwoods, laurels, and willow groves. Nearer the bay, salt marshes and vernal pools dominated the land. Spanish colonial settlers gave the Valley the name *Llano de los Robles* ("Plain of the Oaks") as they established Franciscan missions throughout the Valley. The eighth mission established by Fray José Murguía was given the name Mission Santa Clara de Asís ("Clare" or "Clara" means "clear" or "bright"), giving the valley its current namesake.^[Pedro Font, *Font's Comlete Diary: A Chronicle of the Founding of San Francisco* (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1933), 323--324.] 

The colonial Spanish also saw something else in the land: opportunity. One of those opportunities was agriculture. The alluvial soils provided rich nutrients to the expanding agricultural presence in the Valley. When George Vancouver nosed his ship into the Bay to visit Mission San Jose in 1792, he admired the crops of wheat, maize, peas, and beans, "which had been obtained with little labour and without manure." The Mission's gardens contained peaches, apricots, pears, and fig trees. Vancouver noted the soil and climate seemed "well adapted to most sorts of fruit."^[Vancouver quoted in @scott1959bayarea, 12.] Vancouver overlooked Ohlone contributions to the land, noting only that they "still remained in the most abject state of uncivilization."^[@booker2012tide, 20.] But Ohlones had transformed the land---they hunted game, trapped fish and netted waterfowl, harvested shellfish, planted seeds, lit fires to control brush buildup, and perhaps collected salt from naturally evaporating ponds for trade.^[@booker2012tide.] European settlers expanded such transformations, establishing larger plots of land for farms and ranches. Plants not before seen on the California coast became common features on the land of Alta California. By the time Vancouver visited the missions, San José was producing enough cattle and crops to fully support the mission as well as the Spanish presidios in Monterey and San Francisco.

European humans were not alone in transforming the landscape. European animals did as well. A French merchant visiting the Santa Clara and San José missions in 1828 estimated that twelve thousand cattle and fifteenth thousand sheep grazed on the hills. The perennial bunchgrasses that were once common on the hillsides of the valley all but disappeared as animals devoured them and were crowded out by less-desirable grazing annuals. New plants transplanted from seeds brought along by the Spanish, either intentionally or not, also took root in the Valley. The changing grasses also left the hillsides more susceptible to erosion. Greater erosion changed the Valley's waterways, allowing runoff to deposit voluminous mud that destroyed roads and filled river outlets into the bay.^[@booker2012tide, 24--26; @walker2007countrycity, 26--28; Milliken, *Time of Little Choice*, 72--74, 98--99, 148, 221; @pitti2004devil, 20--23. Californios especially after independence from Spain in 1821 increased their reliance on the cattle industry, expanding their presence to meet a demand for hide and tallow. @tsu2013garden, 18.]

The same climate and soils that proved so nutrient-dense for crops was also an ideal condition for trees. The great collections of redwoods, oaks, and riparian groves that grew along the Santa Cruz range or along rivers in the flatlands commanded the attention of timberers who sought to realize fortunes from nature. Spanish missionaries used such wood sources primarily for construction rather than an item for markets. Not until the arrival of Americans in the mid-nineteenth century would logging become a commodity for sale. Redwood City, for example, originated with the establishment of a lumber wharf in the southwest end of the San Francisco Bay in the 1860s, floating cut timber northward up the Bay to the shipping ports in San Francisco. William Page arrived in California from New York around 1860, relocating to Palo Alto in 1879 after he purchased a lumberyard and timber lands near Mill Creek. Page's Mill Road---now the scenic route Old Page Mill Road outside Palo Alto---became a major thoroughfare for moving lumber out of Palo Alto to the wharfs in Redwood City.^[Ralph Hansen, "Historical Notes of Interest Surrounding Page Mill Road and Environs," 1, n.d., Folder 9, Box 1, Page Mill Co-ordinating Committee Records, Stanford University.]

The cultivation of fruit marked the end of widespread wheat growing. Santa Clara County ranked fifth in the state for its wheat production in 1870, but within a quarter century fruit became the dominant crop. And with income per orchard exceeding wheat fields, farmers enthusiastically adopted specialty fruit crops. The Santa Clara Valley was coined the "Garden of the World" and San Jose the "Garden City" by boosters, who gleefully noted the "innumerable homesteads surrounded by orchards and in which hundreds of happy families repose, literally under their own vines and fig trees."^[Quoted in @tsu2013garden, 20.] Acres of wheat were replaced with acres of orchards, thousands of trees blossoming each year to produce prunes, apples, pears, apricots, and cherries.

Water perhaps has been the most significant natural feature playing a role in the Santa Clara Valley. Water, at times, seemed too abundant. Heavy rains around 1791 flooded Mission San José. Spanish missionaries would eventually relocate San Jose three times to get away from an erratically flooding Guadalupe River. But if water could be too abundant, it could also be fickle. The Guadalupe River often became devoid of water during the critical growing months of summer. Missionaries, usually with labor provided by Ohlone, constructed dams on the Guadalupe to begin capturing the waters when they flowed, which found its way into canals and ditches to crop fields.^[Arbuckle, 11; @friedly2000eden, 112; @mars1901reminiscences, 25.] Not until the arrival of Americans were wells sunk to tap into underground water supplies.

![Poplar City. **Need more metadata here**.](figures/poplarcity.png)

The arrival of Americans transformed the land even more profoundly. As historian Donald Pisani has noted, "free mining had conditioned Californians to look at all land solely in terms of quick wealth." What happened under that understanding was "the same lack of attachment to place, the same lack of community, the same shortsightedness, and the same obsession with profit characterized both mining and agriculture, at least until horticulture gained in popularity during the 1870s and 1880s."^[Pisani, "'I am resolved not to interfere, but permit all to work freely': The Gold Rush and American Resource Law," *A Golden State: Mining and Economic Development in Gold Rush California*, eds., James J. Rawls and Richard J. Orsi (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1999), 144.] When Americans took control of San Jose in 1846, one of their first moves was to construct a four-foot-wide canal running from the Guadalupe River to the town in order to irrigate gardens and fields, water livestock, and provide drinking water.^[Hall, 186.] As the population grew, so did the demand on water. In 1854, when San Jose was still the capital of California, the first wells were sunk into the earth. Diggers struck water at fifty-five feet below the surface of the earth, continued digging until they reached eighty feet, then drilled through an impermeable layer of rock into a pressurized artesian well.^[Hall, *San Jose*, 263.] The Spanish and Ohlone did not know of the artesian reservoir's existence; the reservoir had simply collected water for centuries until it was first pierced by a six-inch diameter well.^[Friedly, 329.] Shortly after the first well was bored, two additional wells were drilled nearby.^[Hall, 263--264.] Americans became convinced that they had discovered an inexhaustible supply of water. San Jose booster Frederick Hall could hardly contain his excitement. "As this year [1854] came rolling in," he wrote, 

> the artesian water first came surging up from its hidden depths, to play and

> valley.^[Frederick Hall, *San Jose*, 262--263.]

The fickleness of the valley's water supply, however, plagued Americans. While the early wells that tapped into the artesian system provided abundant water---at times too much, as when G. A. Dabney's drilling released so much pressurized water it flooded the streets of San Jose in six feet of water for several weeks---by the 1860s the availability of water started wavering.^[Hall, *San Jose*, 264.] Severe floods in 1861 overflowed the Coyote and Guadalupe Rivers and killed thousands of cattle, yet in the three years after the floods a prolonged drought killed thousands more. In 1862 Santa Clara County had around 19,000 cattle on the rangelands; by 1868, that figure had fallen to 10,000. Adding to the problem was outbreaks of big jaw and Texas fever that swept through the Valley in the early 1860s.^[Friedly, 301--302.] The instability of cattle raising led to a shift in agriculture as rangelands began their conversion to croplands. The cattle culture that had been introduced by the Spanish ninety years earlier fell away as ranchers subdivided their lands to farmers. Wheat cultivation especially took off in the 1860s. In 1852 farmers produced 122,192 bushels of wheat, rising to 550,000 bushels by 1860, and topping 1.2 million bushels by 1870---a 872% increase in twenty years. Farming quickly became the dominant agricultural activity. While ranching remained dominant in 1860, nearly 26,000 acres were converted into farmers by 1857. By 1863, 165,000 acres were under cultivation, and by the end of the decade farming dominated they valley.^[Friedly, 302, 306--307; Foote, *Pen Pictures*, 23; Hall, 444--445.]

The severe droughts in the 1860s forced farmers to rely heavily on the groundwater supplies, which had the predictable effect of lowering the groundwater table. Americans understood groundwater recharge and overdraft, and before long comprehended that the artesian system was all interconnected. As one well drew water supplies, it lowered the availability of all the other wells.^[Freidly, 333--335.] Some Americans continued to live by what historian Michael Friedly called the "illusion of inexhaustibility," noting one writer in 1876 who gleefully noted the Valley's "supply [of artesian water] is inexhaustible, and would, with the inauguration of the proper system, be sufficient to irrigate the entire valley."^[Quoted in Friedly, 338.] Yet the droughts and dwindling artesian supplies led American capitalists to pursue alternative forms of water supply. In November 1866, businessmen organized the San Jose Water Company (SJWC) to supply water to its residents. The towns of San Jose and Santa Clara gave the company a twenty-five-year lease to pursue water resource development and provide the towns with reliable water. SJWC first turned to artesian wells, but as overdraft continued to exhaust the supply they sought out the flowing waters of the Los Gatos Creek. Flowing from the Santa Cruz Mountains into the Guadalupe River west of San Jose, SJWC built a network of pipes and a 2.5 million gallon reservoir to funnel water to its customers.^[Hall, 305--307.] The artesian supply would continue to be unreliable. The end of the droughts in the late 1860s began filling the underground reservoirs again, but when drought returned in the 1870s the supply again ran dry.^[Friedly, 336--337.]

The shift from ranching to farming also led to widespread clearcutting of trees. Eager to clear the land for maximum availability of cultivation, farmers cut down oak woodlands and willow groves, filled vernal pools, and reclaimed salt marshes to expand the amount of land available for farming. The cutting of trees also formed a core business for timber interests. Returning Gold Rush seekers often went into the lumber business rather than farming. By 1857 twelve sawmills were active in Santa Clara Valley. Groves and woodlands were quickly cleared and transformed into land for cultivation.^[Foote, *Pen Pictures*, 21.] When aspiring homesteader Bernard Reid moved to Santa Clara in 1851, he noted that most wood for fuel was hauled in from three miles away. There was no nearby lumber available for the town.^[Gordon, "Little Italy," 12.] As oak woodlands disappeared from the Valley floor, timbermen went into the hills for the redwoods. By the 1880s, much of the accessible forests in the Santa Cruz Mountains were logged.^[Friedly, 317.] 

Cattle ranching, wheat and grain production, and quicksilver mining flourished in the Valley in the late nineteenth century prior to the Valley becoming "one vast orchard."^[San Jose Chamber of Commerce, *San José, Santa Clara County, California* (San Jose: San Jose Chamber of Commerce, 1910, 4); Tsu, *Garden of the World*, 17.] By the end of the nineteenth century, fruit production had surpassed all other agricultural, mining, and timbering activity. The growth of Silicon Valley occurred upon some of California's most fertile lands. A survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture designated 400 square kilometers---32 percent---of Santa Clara County as Class 1 land, the highest ranking possible for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables. Water systems flowing into the valley carved out rich alluvial fans in the Valley. Below topsoil loam---in some places measuring forty feet deep---are gravel and clay freshwater aquifers, which nineteenth century farmers reached with artesian wells that provided a consistent supply of fresh water.^[Aaron Sachs, "Virtual Ecology," *World Watch*, 15.] Santa Clara Valley farms remained relatively small. In 1900, the typical farm was under fifty acres; in 1920, the average farm size was forty acres and dropped to thirty-two acres by 1950.^[Tsu, *Garden of the World*, 6.] Agricultural activity by the 1940s witnessed around 6,000 farms in the Valley, mostly family--run operations that totaled around 132,000 acres and some eight million cherry, apricot, and pear trees.^[Sachs, "Virtual Ecology," 16.] By the end of the nineteenth century, as the region became a prominent agricultural producer, *Sunset* magazine writers labeled it "The Valley of Heart's Delight" and "The Delectable Valley" due to its reputation as a major fruit producer. The production of prunes, walnuts, and apricots, the economic staples of the Valley, were consumed all over the world.^[G. von Vieregg, "Santa Clara: The Delectable Valley," *Sunset*, August 1912; E. Alexander Powell, "The Valley of Heart's Delight," *Sunset*, August 1912.] As late as the 1950s, canneries processed more than thirty percent of the state's crop of fruit and vegetables. Although the valley itself only produced a small portion of the crop, the facilities for canning, drying, and freezing were located near rail, highway, and water routes in the South Bay.^[Paul Griffin and Ronald Chatham, "An Industrial Analysis of North Santa Clara County," County of Santa Clara Planning Department, 3.]

\thoughtbreak{The agrarian culture that had come to dominate} the Valley was exalted not only for its remarkable productivity but also for its aesthetics and promise of the "good life." When John Muir passed through the Valley in the spring of 1872, he remarked that the Santa Clara Valley's climate was "the best we ever enjoyed."^[John Muir, *John Muir: His Life and Letters and Other Writings*, ed. Terry Gifford (Seattle: Mountaineers, 1996), 96.] The French writer Amaury Mars agreed. When he visited the Santa Clara Valley in 1901, he remarked that "no spot in the world has Nature been more lavish of her gifts. The heat is never oppressive nor the cold severe; there is never too much moisture, while thunder storms and, above all, cyclones are altogether unknown here."^[@mars1901reminiscences, 76.] The valley's landscape offered a compelling tale: a veritable garden; indeed, the Garden of the World. The story was uncomplicated, and in its simplicity it masked historical realities of the landscape. 

Above all, the orchard had become a symbol of the Valley as a paradise on earth.

Orchards required water, and lots of it. 

In addition to copious amounts of water, the orchards generated tremendous levels of waste. Much of the waste came in the form of cannery effluence. To aid the canneries in their production, San Jose especially became a willing partner. Beginning in the 1870s the small farm town began construction of a storm and sewage system that would funnel wastes away from the city. Much of the waste found itself dumped into the San Francisco Bay. While the system seemed to effectively deal with the problem of waste in the city, it had the effect of upsetting the Bay's ecosystems. The dumping of the city's waste into the Bay all but destroyed the clam and shrimp industries as the contamination of water caused steadily-increasing dieoffs that made the raising and harvesting of molluscan fisheries unprofitable.^[@stanfordlaw1971sanjose, 13; John E. Skinner, *An Historical Review of the Fish and Wildlife Resources of the San Francisco Bay Area*, California Department of Fish and Game, (June 1962), 100; Dreisbach, *Handbook of the San Francisco Region*, 155; Charles Gilman Hyde and George Leonard Sullivan, *Santa Clara County Sewage Disposal Survey; Report upon the Collection, Treatment and Disposal of Sewage and Industrial Wastes of Santa Clara County* (Ann Arbor: Edward Brothers, 1946), 101--102.] 

The orchards introduced additional modifications to the environment. In the late 1880s, the invention of a spray pump by John Bean of Los Gatos allowed growers to control pests and insects more easily.^[With his pest control plant and several small canneries, Bean founded the Food Machinery and Chemical Corporation in San Jose in {DATE}.] The orchards also clouded the skies with soot. Orchardists employed the use of smudgepots --- a device comprised of a basin that held kerosene and a chimney-like pipe emerging roughly five feet high --- to warm orchard fields and prevent frosts from damaging fruits. Usually lit and burned through the duration of the night, the smudgepots cast smoke and oily soot into the air. Californians recalled waking up after cool nights to find themselves covered in an oily film from the kerosene burners, and children were loathe to arrive at school with "smudge face."^[Farmer, *Trees in Paradise*, 294--296; Chapman, *California Apricots*, 90--91.. Smudgepots were more commonly used in other parts of California, especially in Southern California which experienced cold two kinds of cold snaps, either through atmospheric inversion or from Arctic air sweeping down through the Great Basin across the Mojave Desert and into California. Nevertheless, smudgepots were still occasionally used in the Valley. See Farmer, *Trees in Paradise*, 291--292.]

What historian Mark Fiege concluded for nineteenth-century Idaho---that Americans crafted a story of "pioneers [who] conquered the howling wilderness and transformed it into beautiful, productive fields and farms"---could be equally applied to the Santa Clara Valley.^[@fiege1999eden, 171.] The story was a powerful one in American culture. The land was one of Eden, and the garden myth that emerged in the nineteenth century would maintain a powerful grip on the human imposition of ideas onto nature.

By the twentieth century, the Valley landscape embodied features not part of the land but deeply informed by land: laws, institutions, attitudes, and policies were intricately tied to the land, as were the natural world of water, soil, plants, and animals.^[@fiege1999eden, 171.] 

The exceptional growing climate, fertile soil, and plentiful water from artesian wells allowed farmers to transform the landscape into the fruit capital it would be known as worldwide. By the 1920s, Santa Clara Valley led the state in fruit production, drying, canning, and packing, providing a range of products such as cherries, prunes, apricots, pears, peaches, plums, and apples. By 1930, Santa Clara County produced between one-third to one-half of the world's prune supply.^[Glenna Matthews, *Silicon Valley, Women, and the California Dream: Gender, Class, and Opportunity in the Twentieth Century* (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2002), 18; Cecilia Tsu, *Garden of the World*, 17.] The cultivation and processing of apricots, prunes, pears, and cherries became staples on the horticulture landscape.^[Edward N. Torbert, "The Specialized Commercial Agriculture of the Northern Santa Clara Valley," *Geographical Review* 26 (April 1936): 247---263.] Fruit trees produced a canopy of pink and white blossoms along with orange California poppies and other native wildflowers that bloomed on the hillsides. The blooming seasons were popular early in the twentieth century as visitors flocked to the area to behold the orchards in full bloom, along with farmhouses, berry patches, vegetable gardens, and pastures.^[Edith Brockway, *San Jose Reflections: An Illustrated History of San Jose, California and Some of Surrounding Area* (Campbell, Calif.: Academy Press, 1977), 132--133.] Little wonder why the Santa Clara Valley boosters advertised the area as "nearest Paradise" and "the best spot in the whole earth," a place where "the Eden of vine and tree" was a "God-favored spot" and "God's favorite valley."^[Quotes from Tsu, *Garden of the World*, 3--4. *Picturesque San Jose and Environments: An Illustrated Statement of the Progress, Prosperity, and Resources of Santa Clara County, California* (San Jose: H. S. Foote and C. A. Woolfolk, 1893), n.p.; *The Progressive City Beautiful: Santa Clara* (Santa Clara Chamber of Commerce, n.d.); E. Alexander Powell, "The Valley of Heart's Delight," *Sunset* 29 (August 1912), 120.] 

Americans admired their handiwork on the land. In 1894 San Jose held its first agricultural festival at Agricultural Park that featured appearances by Arizona Charlie's troupe, Doc Goodwin's horse riders, fireworks, and dancing, to celebrate the agricultural bounty of the Valley. By the early 1900s Saratoga advertised "blossom week" hosted by the Santa Clara County Improvement Club where visitors flocked to the valley to view orchards in full bloom. Such pilgrimages to nature continued well into the late 1950s, when residents and visitors  could take part of "Blossom Tours" throughout the Valley that allowed them to view fruit trees in full bloom at various times of the year.^["San Jose's Fiesta," *San Francisco Chronicle*, May 22, 1894; "Blossom Festival in Santa Clara Valley," *San Francisco Chroncile*, March 22, 1902; "Santa Clara's Blossom Festival," *San Francisco Chronicle*, April 6, 1903.]

Fruit cultivation placed particular demands on the land and cities. To the land, fruit trees were foreign yet well-adapted to the climate. Yet the trees offered another advantage: their root systems became a check against erosion.

The cities, especially San Jose, sought to accommodate the fruit industry through its infrastructure. One pressing need was sewers that could handle the effluence produced by canneries. 

The orchards found expression on the landscape of the Valley's infrastructure. Street names of Blossom Hill, Cherry, Apricot, Hillsdale, and Cherrydale expressed a landscape intimately tied to the farms.
