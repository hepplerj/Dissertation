The region now known as Silicon Valley has gone through numerous 
redefinitions. The Ohlone people, Penutian-speakers who likely migrated to the 
Valley from the eastern foothills of the Central Valley around the 6th century 
CE, displaced or assimilated Hokan-speaking populations already living in the 
Valley. Spanish colonial settlers referred to the valley as “Llano de los 
Robles” (Plain of the Oaks), a name bestowed on the valley by José Francisco 
establishing Franciscan missions in the valley. The eighth mission established 
by Father Serra was given the name Mission Santa Clara de Asís ("Clare" or 
"Clara" means 'clear' or "bright"). In August 1912, Sunset magazine labeled it 
"The Valley of Heart’s Delight" or alternatively "The Delectable Valley" due 
to its reputation as a fruit producer. The production of prunes, walnuts, and 
apricots, the economic staples of the valley, were consumed all over the 
world.^[Friedly, 35-36; G. von Vieregg, “Santa Clara: The Delectable Valley,” 
*Sunset*, August 1912; E. Alexander Powell, “The Valley of Heart’s Delight,” 
*Sunset*, August 1912.]

The Bay Area shed its agricultural past and embraced its post-industrial 
suburban future following World War II. In 1949, the City of Santa Clara 
published a brochure boasting itself “known as the Prune Center of the World.” 
Fifteen years later, Santa Clara issued a new pamphlet that made no mention of 
trees or fruit. Instead, the city promoted itself as “Geared for 
Growth.”^[Cavin, “Citizenship,” 230.] Between 1944 and 1962, businesses 
invested $290 million in new industrial plants that made Santa Clara County 
“the industrial colossus of the Bay Area.” The pamphlet emphasized the vast 
amounts of land available for industry, research, and development. In boasting 
about it’s water infrastructure, the city meant not water for crops but 
manufacturing processes, industrial effluent, and sewage. “We in Santa Clara,” 
Howard Kingston, president of the Chamber, stated, “have created an atmosphere 
for industry that is designed to help each and every firm tell a profit 
story.”^[Santa Clara Chamber of Commerce, “Industrial Introduction to the City 
of Santa Clara,” 1964.]

This chapter will set the early stage of the story, charting the Valley's 
agricultural past and its transitioning to an industrial and urban landscape. 
The landscape that emerged in the Valley in the mid- to late-nineteenth 
century was human-created, a landscape of orchards, farmland, and ranching, 
perceptions of "natural" that would be lost in the face of urban development. 
This "natural" landscape would be looked upon nostalgically as the Bay Area's 
new industrial economy began to reshape the landscape.% Pre-Valley Farms%

from Cavin:
> Whyte put his hopes in an alliance of farmers and legislators. Farmers 
> joined with agricultural representatives to enact legislation that would 
> protect farmland from development. They sought tax abatements for farmers 
> who abutted subdivisions. Tract homes raised tax assessments on adjacent 
> orchards, but orchards did not provide the massive profits of developments. 
> Without tax abatements, farmers argued, they would be taxed out of 
> business.^[Cavin, 211.]
