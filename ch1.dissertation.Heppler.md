Chapter 1 will set the stage for the mid-twentieth century. The chapter will begin by sketching out the three hybrid landscapes that existed in California: the agricultural landscape, the urban landscape, and the industrial landscape. As noted above, these landscapes were conceptual and physical constructions. The chapter will also introduce readers to the history leading up postwar California, and lay the groundwork found in agriculture, mining, and timbering operations that demanded large amounts of water. The chapter will largely be a general look at water in California prior to 1945. Chapter 2 will start a more focused examination of the Valley's history. The rest of the chapter lays out the rest of the groundwork by surveying urban growth and industrial growth, charting the rise of electronics manufacturing in Santa Clara County beginning in the early twentieth century and will end after World War II. This will be key to examining the early industrial work being built up by Stanford University. Chapter 1 brings the story up to the post-agricultural, postwar suburban and industrial development, which will be the primary focus of this dissertation.

In 1951, Stanford University founded the Stanford Industrial Park, a
visionary land development that sought to attract electronics
manufacturers and researchers to the Midpeninsula. Perhaps no place more
embodied mid-twentieth century politics than the Bay Area: a place of
optimism, defined by its connections to the Cold War military-industrial
complex, proud of its patriotism and contribution to anticommunism. In
the years after World War II, millions of migrants established new homes
in northern California to take jobs in high technology, defense,
biomedical, professional, and service industries. Single-family homes
sprouted across the California landscape for families and their children
in one of the largest demographic shifts in American history. They came
for jobs, for opportunities, for beautiful landscape, and for climate.
The Santa Clara Valley, after all, was "God's favorite valley."[^cf1]
The suburban Midpeninsula not only became home to what would become a
massive economic sector and homes for thousands of Americans, but stood
at the center of a powerful grassroots political movement. An
invigorated environmental politics --- fueled by the loss of open space,
damaged wilderness areas, rampant suburban sprawl, and environmental
disasters --- burst onto the scene in the 1960s. Santa Clara Valley
stood at the center of the new political impulse. As tech companies
sprang up in garages, environmental movements sprang up in living
rooms.[^cf2] Residents around backyard barbecues, around kitchen tables,
and inside community clubs formed coalitions to champion ecological
stewardship and raise environmental awareness. In so doing, they became
significant voices in local, state, and national politics and stood at
the forefront of a growing political environmental movement. But before
that story begins, we must set the scene: the Santa Clara Valley and its
history, political and cultural heritage, its economic development, and
agricultural past. The Valley's agricultural history helped foster the
growth of an environmental movement.

The region now known as Silicon Valley has gone through numerous
redefinitions. The Ohlone people, Penutian-speakers who likely migrated
to the Santa Clara Valley from the eastern foothills of the Central
Valley around the sixth century C.E., displaced or assimilated
Hokan-speaking populations already living in the area. Spanish colonial
settlers arriving around 1769 referred to the valley as *Llano de los
Robles* ("Plain of the Oaks") as they established Franciscan missions
throughout the Valley. The eighth mission established by Fray José
Murguía was given the name Mission Santa Clara de Asís ("Clare" or
"Clara" means "clear" or "bright"), giving the valley its current
namesake. By the end of the nineteenth century, as the region became a
prominent agricultural producer, Sunset magazine labeled it "The Valley
of Heart's Delight" or alternatively "The Delectable Valley" due to its
reputation as a major fruit producer. The production of prunes, walnuts,
and apricots, the economic staples of the valley, were consumed all over
the world.[^cf3]

The Bay Area shed its agricultural past and embraced its post-industrial
suburban future following World War II. In 1949, the City of Santa Clara
published a brochure boasting itself "known as the Prune Center of the
World." Fifteen years later, Santa Clara issued a new pamphlet that made
no mention of trees or fruit. Instead, the city promoted itself as
"Geared for Growth."[^cf4] Between 1944 and 1962, businesses invested
\$290 million in new industrial plants that made Santa Clara County "the
industrial colossus of the Bay Area." The pamphlet emphasized the vast
amounts of land available for industry, research, and development. In
boasting about it's water infrastructure, the city meant not water for
crops but manufacturing processes, industrial effluent, and sewage. "We
in Santa Clara," Howard Kingston, president of the Chamber, stated,
"have created an atmosphere for industry that is designed to help each
and every firm tell a profit story."[^cf5]

This chapter will set the early stage of the story, charting the
Valley's shift to an agricultural landscape while charting the ways that
nineteenth and early twentieth century people reshaped the landscape
into their image of nature. The landscape that emerged in the Valley in
the mid- to late-nineteenth century was human-created, a landscape of
orchards, farmland, and ranching, generating perceptions of "natural"
that would be lost in the face of urban development. This "natural"
landscape would be looked upon nostalgically as the Bay Area's new high
technology economy began to reshape the landscape.

## Land's Past

Nearly 12,000 years ago the San Francisco Bay Area began to take shape. 
As the Wisconsin glaciation period was ending the collision of the 
Pacific and North American tectonic plates generated uplift. The 
collision forced the coastline northward along the San Andreas fault, 
which caused additional uplift creating the coastal range along the 
California coast.  The uplift also reshaped the flow of water. By the 
end of the glacial period, a single river flowed across what would 
become Santa Clara Valley, meeting with the Sacramento River to the east 
and flowing to the lowest point along the Coast Range. Although the 
glaciers never reached coastal California, the changing climate reshaped 
the region's ecology. The melting glaciers increased sea levels that 
flooded the majority of the Santa Clara Valley, creating the San 
Francisco Bay. Nearly 5,000 years ago, the landscape of the present Bay 
Area had nearly taken shape.^[@friedly2000santaclara, 18.]

## Spanish Settlement

The Santa Clara Valley had a two-century history as an agricultural
region. San José, among the earliest Spanish settlements in Alta
California, had been settled predominantly as an agricultural settlement
to support the Spanish presidios in Monterey and San Francisco. By the
late 1700s, San José was producing enough cattle and crops that it fully
supported the settlement as well as Monterey and San Francisco. The town
relocated three times to get away from an erratically flooding Guadalupe
River.

Santa Clara County benefited from its location. As late as the 1950s,
canneries processed more than thirty percent of the state's crop of
fruit and vegetables. Although the valley itself produced only a small
portion of the crop, the facilities for canning, drying, and freezing
were located near rail, highway, and water routes.[^cf6]

## Radio and Microwave

Well before the Valley became known for its semiconductor production, it
was already integrating itself into the flourishing industry of
electronics and microwaves.

Whyte put his hopes in an alliance of farmers and legislators. Farmers joined with agricultural representatives to enact legislation that would protect farmland from development. They sought tax abatements for farmers who abutted subdivisions. Tract homes raised tax assessments on adjacent orchards, but orchards did not provide the massive profits of developments. Without tax abatements, farmers argued, they would be taxed out of business.[^cf7]
