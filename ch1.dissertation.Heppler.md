The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation anticipated little
opposition to their plans to build the Ronald Reagan Presidential
Library on the campus of Stanford University. Coupled with the Hoover
Institution, whose officials advised Reagan as well as shared his
conservative outlook, the selection of Stanford University for the
presidential library, museum, and public affairs research center seemed
like a natural fit. Yet when Stanford's Board of Trustees approved the
plan in February 1984, the outcry was swift. Faculty and students
objected to the library's presence, fearing it would only serve to
"politicize" Stanford.

But the outcry over the Reagan Library was not only embedded in a
critique of politicizing the university. Place mattered to the critics.
The Reagan Foundation hoped to place the presidential library in the
foothills on unincorporated Stanford property next to the Center for
Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences. The move that drew criticism from
locals as well as university members. "They want to put it on one of the
last undeveloped hills in the community," Samuel Brain, a senior
researcher in Stanford's radiology department and a vocal critic of the
plan. "There are a lot of people who are attached to that hill, and they
don't want it ruined." Furthermore, residents of Palo Alto worried about
the potential of tourists flooding their town with traffic and the ways
tourism would upset the natural seclusion of the hills.[^4]

Debate over the proper use of space is age-old. Richard White's
observation about the West's public lands---that "land cannot be
simultaneously range, parking lots, and wilderness"---applies equally to
spaces in cities.[^5] Spaces are given definition through cultural
processes that determine how land and space should be utilized for
economics, shelter, food, and transportation. Yet there are few times
when these spaces can become a member of more than one category of use.
A city block given the designation of industrial land cannot
simultaneously be residential land. These are not necessarily historical
realities; they are cultural understandings of how particular places are
defined, used, and protected.

If asked to define Silicon Valley, one is likely to picture iPhones,
computers, Steve Jobs, maybe erroneously, Microsoft. This Silicon Valley
is a set of assumptions and attitudes defined by technology, invention,
innovation, venture funding, and capital. But Silicon Valley is also a
place. Few people, when asked about Silicon Valley, would answer that
it's the Santa Clara Valley of northern California. Even those who live
in the Valley are more likely to think of the place not as a *place*,
but as an *ideal*, a philosophy. These two views into Silicon
Valley---as a place, and as a social construction---illustrate how we
can come to understand the Valley's spatial history. We can begin by
asking where the cultural understanding of the Valley as a place for
nature begins. The story begins with agriculture and the creation of a
natural "Eden." We can begin to understand how the Valley was thought of
as a desired place influenced by the Valley's agricultural productivity
and climate. To understand the tensions between users of the
land---should a hillside be a Presidential Library or preserved in a
natural state?---we have to consider where specific ideas about the land
emerged. As the lands became understood as an agricultural bounty, it
also influenced how cities were shaped. The market towns of Santa Clara
Valley adapted to this landscape---San Jose and its canneries and
railroads, Saratoga and Los Gatos and the "agricultural tourism" of the
Valley. These places became defined by their "nature." Before the Valley
became a place of electronics, federal investments, and military
geography, place was defined by it's natural surroundings, the
definition of which would continue into the twentieth century.

\thoughtbreak{The story begins with the land}. As the Wisconsin
glaciation period was ending 12,000 years ago, uplift resulting from the
collision of the Pacific and North American tectonic plates started
shaping the San Francisco Bay Area into its present form. The collision
forced the coastline northward along the San Andreas fault, causing
additional uplift along the entire coast that generated the coastal
range. The new coastal ranges interrupted the flow of air coming off the
Pacific Ocean. At the northern end of the Bay, a stubborn marine layer
created by regular temperature inversions that tended to trap cool,
moist air causing regular fog to drift into the mouth of the Bay. On the
Pacific-facing site of the coastal ranges, the cool, moist air allowed
coastal redwoods to flourish that gives the Santa Cruz Mountains its
green vale year-round. Yet the range also produced a rain shadow for the
flatlands of the Valley, where trees became scarce and grasses took
their place. Hence, the eastern Diablo Range remains dry and khaki brown
during most of the year except during the rainy season. The coastal
ranges protected the Valley from serious frosts, major storms, and
excessive temperatures, giving the region it's reputation as one of the
most temperate environments on the planet.[^6]

The uplift of the coastal range reshaped the flow of water. At the time
the glacial period ended, a single river flowed across what would become
the Santa Clara Valley, meeting with the Sacramento River to the east
and flowing to the lowest point along the Coast Range. Although glaciers
never reached coastal California, the changing global climate reshaped
the region's ecology. The melting glaciers increased sea levels that
flooded the majority of ancient valleys, creating the San Francisco Bay.
Uplift allowed new trickles of water to slowly carve paths into the
landscape. Most river channels were shallow and narrow, prone to
flooding. Most mountain run-off dissipated quickly into the
well--drained alluvial soils and replenished underground aquifers.
Freshwater marshes, seasonally--flooded meadows, forested wetlands, and
riparian habitats were common natural features on the Valley landscape.
Nearly 5,000 years ago, the landscape of the present Bay Area had
largely taken shape.[^7]

Below ground, the Valley was supplied by a regional aquifer that
consisted of multiple Pleistocene aquifers grouped into upper and lower
systems. These groundwater systems were replenished primarily through
precipitation, stream channels, and, today, artificial recharge ponds.
The presence of rock faults also served as potential sources and
barriers of hydrological flows. The Valley had few rivers coursing
through it. Twenty--six major creeks flowed through the Valley, and the
major rivers included the Arroyo Hondo, Guadalupe River, and Pajaro
River, which originated in the Santa Cruz or Diablo Range and emptied
into the Calaveras Reservoir, the San Francisco Bay, and the Pacific
Ocean respectively. A majority of the thirty--seven lakes now in the Bay
Area are artificial or serve as man-made reservoirs. Two major dam
projects, the Coyote Dam built in 1936 and the Anderson Dam built in
1950, began regulating watershed discharge. Recent changes in vegetation
and habitats came about due to changes in stream hydrology that included
flood control efforts and summer water releases from groundwater
recharge associated with the Coyote and Anderson dams.

The interactions of wind, air, and land shaped the layout of the Santa
Clara Valley. Between the Santa Cruz and Diablo ranges, the Valley
widens out from 15 miles across at its northern point near the mouth of
the San Francisco Bay to 25 miles across at its southern end before the
Diablo and Santa Cruz mountains nearly converge to form the Coyote
Narrows. Within these lands, the Valley hosted a variety of lifeforms.
Along the Valley floor, oak scrub, cacti, and a variety of oak, willow,
sycamore, and alder trees provided cover for wildlife and shelters for
native grasses. At higher elevations, a variety of conifers including
coastal redwoods (*Sequoia sempervirens*), ponderosa pine (*pinus
ponderosa*), sugar pine (*pinus lambertiana*) mingled with white fir
(*Abies concolor*) and black oak (*Quercus kelloggii*) that carpeted the
mountains in green. The plants of the Valley adapted to the
Mediterranean climate: perennial bunchgrasses die back every winter,
leaving only roots to help preserve water; oak trees have extensive root
systems to tap into groundwater supplies.[^8] The oak woodlands and
chaparral ecoregions provided habitats for acton woodpeckers, nuthatch,
oak titmouse, and Pacific pallid bats. Major waterways supported a
diverse range of native fish species, including Pacific lamprey
(*Lampetra tridentata*), steelhead trout, chinook salmon, Sacramento
blackfish, and tule perch, among many others. Golden beavers and
raccoons shared the landscape with rabbits, squirrels, and other small
species, as well as a variety of snakes, lizards, spiders, and insects.
Mountain lions, wolves, and grizzly bears once hunted and lived in the
valley, mingling with ungulates such as elk and mule deer. Woodpeckers,
wrentits, scrub jays, Chestnut-backed Chickadees, and hundreds of
additional bird species thrived in the Valley's skies.

\thoughtbreak{The land and the bay were important} environmental and
cultural features to many people. The Ohlone people, Penutian-speakers
that included the Miwok, Wintun, Maidu, and Yokuts who likely migrated
to the Santa Clara Valley from the eastern foothills of the Central
Valley around 6,000 years ago, displaced or assimilated Hokan-speaking
populations already living in the area. When Spanish colonists arrived
in the Valley, Ohlone numbered between 7,000 and 26,000. They subsisted
on the land by collecting acorns from oak trees, hunted game, fished,
and harvested clams and other shellfish from the Bay. The discarded
shells formed the famous shellmounds along the Bay's shores.[^9] Disease
and warfare allowed Spanish settlers to overwhelm Ohlone communities. In
the fifty years between the arrival of Spanish missionaries and the end
of Spanish rule in 1821, Native populations declined by seventy-five
percent in the Bay Area.[^10]

When Spanish colonial settlers first crested the Santa Cruz Mountains in
the late-1760s, they saw a Valley hosting a range of
ecosystems---coastal redwoods and Douglas fir dominated the ridge of the
mountain, giving way to chaparrel shrub that occupied the rockier soils
in the foothills. As the foothills smoothed out into the flatlands of
the valley, grasslands overtook the chaparrel and were dotted with oak
savannahs, cottonwoods, laurels, and willow groves. Nearer the bay, salt
marshes and vernal pools dominated the land. Spanish colonial settlers
gave the Valley the name *Llano de los Robles* ("Plain of the Oaks") as
they established Franciscan missions throughout the Valley. The eighth
mission established by Fray José Murguía was given the name Mission
Santa Clara de Asís ("Clare" or "Clara" means "clear" or "bright"),
giving the valley its current namesake.[^11]

The colonial Spanish also saw something else in the land: opportunity.
One of those opportunities was agriculture. The alluvial soils provided
rich nutrients to the expanding agricultural presence in the Valley.
When George Vancouver nosed his ship into the Bay to visit Mission San
Jose in 1792, he admired the crops of wheat, maize, peas, and beans,
"which had been obtained with little labour and without manure." The
Mission's gardens contained peaches, apricots, pears, and fig trees.
Vancouver noted the soil and climate seemed "well adapted to most sorts
of fruit."[^12] Vancouver overlooked Ohlone contributions to the land,
noting only that they "still remained in the most abject state of
uncivilization."[^13] But Ohlones had transformed the land---they hunted
game, trapped fish and netted waterfowl, harvested shellfish, planted
seeds, lit fires to control brush buildup, and perhaps collected salt
from naturally evaporating ponds for trade.[^14] European settlers
expanded such transformations, establishing larger plots of land for
farms and ranches. Plants not before seen on the California coast became
common features on the land of Alta California. By the time Vancouver
visited the missions, San José was producing enough cattle and crops to
fully support the mission as well as the Spanish presidios in Monterey
and San Francisco.

European humans were not alone in transforming the landscape. European
animals did as well. A French merchant visiting the Santa Clara and San
José missions in 1828 estimated that twelve thousand cattle and
fifteenth thousand sheep grazed on the hills. The perennial bunchgrasses
that were once common on the hillsides of the valley all but disappeared
as animals devoured them and were crowded out by less-desirable grazing
annuals. New plants transplanted from seeds brought along by the
Spanish, either intentionally or not, also took root in the Valley. The
changing grasses also left the hillsides more susceptible to erosion.
Greater erosion changed the Valley's waterways, allowing runoff to
deposit voluminous mud that destroyed roads and filled river outlets
into the bay.[^15]

The same climate and soils that proved so nutrient-dense for crops was
also an ideal condition for trees. The great collections of redwoods,
oaks, and riparian groves that grew along the Santa Cruz range or along
rivers in the flatlands commanded the attention of timberers who sought
to realize fortunes from nature. Spanish missionaries used such wood
sources primarily for construction rather than an item for markets. Not
until the arrival of Americans in the mid-nineteenth century would
logging become a commodity for sale. Redwood City, for example,
originated with the establishment of a lumber wharf in the southwest end
of the San Francisco Bay in the 1860s, floating cut timber northward up
the Bay to the shipping ports in San Francisco. William Page arrived in
California from New York around 1860, relocating to Palo Alto in 1879
after he purchased a lumberyard and timber lands near Mill Creek. Page's
Mill Road---now the scenic route Old Page Mill Road outside Palo
Alto---became a major thoroughfare for moving lumber out of Palo Alto to
the wharfs in Redwood City.[^16]

The cultivation of fruit marked the end of widespread wheat growing.
Santa Clara County ranked fifth in the state for its wheat production in
1870, but within a quarter century fruit became the dominant crop. And
with income per orchard exceeding wheat fields, farmers enthusiastically
adopted specialty fruit crops. The Santa Clara Valley was coined the
"Garden of the World" and San Jose the "Garden City" by boosters, who
gleefully noted the "innumerable homesteads surrounded by orchards and
in which hundreds of happy families repose, literally under their own
vines and fig trees."[^17] Acres of wheat were replaced with acres of
orchards, thousands of trees blossoming each year to produce prunes,
apples, pears, apricots, and cherries.

Water perhaps has been the most significant natural feature playing a
role in the Santa Clara Valley. Water, at times, seemed too abundant.
Heavy rains around 1791 flooded Mission San José. Spanish missionaries
would eventually relocate San Jose three times to get away from an
erratically flooding Guadalupe River. But if water could be too
abundant, it could also be fickle. The Guadalupe River often became
devoid of water during the critical growing months of summer.
Missionaries, usually with labor provided by Ohlone, constructed dams on
the Guadalupe to begin capturing the waters when they flowed, which
found its way into canals and ditches to crop fields.[^18] Not until the
arrival of Americans were wells sunk to tap into underground water
supplies.

\thoughtbreak{American emigrants, primary Irish Catholics, began arriving}
in the 1840s and quickly seized Californios property through squatting,
stealing horses, and killing cattle. Following the Mexican-American War,
the Santa Clara Valley became part of America in 1848. Anglo-Americans
quickly began seizing property, ignoring stipulations in the Treaty of
Guadalupe-Hildalgo that Mexican-held property would remain in their
hands. The passage of the California Land Act on March 3, 1851, placed
the burden of property rights onto Californios who lacked both knowledge
about the workings of the American justice system as well as extensive
documentation about their property holdings. Under the Land Act,
Californios land holdings quickly eroded as Anglo-Americans sought to
replace the Californios economic base with their own.[^19]

American shifts in the Valley's agricultural pursuits shaped the
landscape. As cattle ranching gave way to wheat farming and, later,
orchard production, Anglo-Americans reshaped the land to serve their
needs. When farmers of the Santa Clara Valley began irrigating their
lands, they added a level of environmental change to a land that had
already undergone momentous change at the hands of humans. Not only were
these farmers, bringing their crops and livestock into the Valley,
creating a mythic ideal of the Valley's productivity but they also
transformed the land in ways unintended. New flora and fauna---planted
crop seeds, hidden seeds smuggled into the folds of clothing, cattle,
oxen, pigs---created a hybrid landscape. As agriculture began to give
way to the postindustrial high-technology industry, more changes to the
waterscape introduced further changes in habitat, flora, and fauna.

The flow of the Valley's waterscape---the rivers, canals, reservoirs,
dams, creeks, and streams that comprised this landscape---would emerge
as a hybrid landscape that both aided and hindered humans. The
ecological transformations of the Valley swung between destruction and
creation. The engineering of a new waterscape meant destruction. The
building of new dams, reservoirs, and canals interrupted the water's
flow across the landscape, which in turn destroyed or drastically
altered habitats used by other flora and fauna.

The water engineers thought little about the destructive aspects of
their projects. Indeed, for many these projects were signs of progress
and improvement---of human's ability to bend nature to their will. The
drilling of numerous wells across the Valley allowed farmers to tap into
an unused water source beneath them. In 1854, when San Jose was still
the capital of California, the first wells were sunk into the earth.
Diggers struck water at fifty-five feet below the surface of the earth,
continued digging until they reached eighty feet, then drilled through
an impermeable layer of rock into a pressurized artesian well.[^20] The
Spanish and Ohlone did not know of the artesian reservoir's existence;
the reservoir had simply collected water for centuries until it was
first pierced by a six-inch diameter well.[^21] Shortly after the first
well was bored, two additional wells were drilled nearby.[^22] Americans
became convinced that they had discovered an inexhaustible supply of
water. San Jose booster Frederick Hall could hardly contain his
excitement. "As this year [1854] came rolling in," he wrote,

> the artesian water first came surging up from its hidden depths, to
> play and sparkle in the living light of day. What a change! What a
> wealth for this beautiful valley! Far beyond in value the discovery of

> was the only thing that seemed to be wanting. All had felt that the
> scarcity of water for irrigation, and good for drinking, were the
> great necessaries of this lovely valley.[^23]

The fickleness of the valley's water supply, however, plagued Americans.
While the early wells that tapped into the artesian system provided
abundant water---at times too much, as when G. A. Dabney's drilling
released so much pressurized water it flooded the streets of San Jose in
six feet of water for several weeks---by the 1860s the availability of
water started wavering.[^24] Severe floods in 1861 overflowed the Coyote
and Guadalupe Rivers and killed thousands of cattle, yet in the three
years after the floods a prolonged drought killed thousands more. In
1862 Santa Clara County had around 19,000 cattle on the rangelands; by
1868, that figure had fallen to 10,000. Outbreaks of big jaw and Texas
fever swept through the Valley in the early 1860s, adding to the
shifting preference away from ranching.[^25] The instability of cattle
raising led to a shift in agriculture as rangelands began their
conversion to croplands. The cattle culture that had been introduced by
the Spanish ninety years earlier fell away as ranchers subdivided their
lands to farmers. Wheat cultivation especially took off in the 1860s. In
1852 farmers produced 122,192 bushels of wheat, rising to 550,000
bushels by 1860, and topping 1.2 million bushels by 1870---a 872%
increase in twenty years. Farming quickly became the dominant
agricultural activity. While ranching remained dominant in 1860, nearly
26,000 acres were converted into farmers by 1857. By 1863, 165,000 acres
were under cultivation, and by the end of the decade farming dominated
they valley.[^26]

The severe droughts in the 1860s forced farmers to rely heavily on the
groundwater supplies, which had the predictable effect of lowering the
groundwater table. Americans understood groundwater recharge and
overdraft, and before long comprehended that the artesian system was all
interconnected. As one well drew water supplies, it lowered the
availability of all the other wells.[^27] Some Americans continued to
live by what historian Michael Friedly called the "illusion of
inexhaustibility," noting one writer in 1876 who gleefully noted the
Valley's "supply [of artesian water] is inexhaustible, and would, with
the inauguration of the proper system, be sufficient to irrigate the
entire valley."[^28] Yet the droughts and dwindling artesian supplies
led American capitalists to pursue alternative forms of water supply. In
November 1866, businessmen organized the San Jose Water Company (SJWC)
to supply water to its residents. The towns of San Jose and Santa Clara
gave the company a twenty-five-year lease to pursue water resource
development and provide the towns with reliable water. SJWC first turned
to artesian wells, but as overdraft continued to exhaust the supply they
sought out the flowing waters of the Los Gatos Creek. Flowing from the
Santa Cruz Mountains into the Guadalupe River west of San Jose, SJWC
built a network of pipes and a 2.5 million gallon reservoir to funnel
water to its customers.[^29] The artesian supply would continue to be
unreliable. The end of the droughts in the late 1860s began filling the
underground reservoirs again, but when drought returned in the 1870s the
supply again ran dry.[^30]

![B.S. Fox's nursery along the Coyote River. *Thompson & West Atlas*, 1876.](figures/fox-nursery.png)

Yet these water projects introduced unanticipated problems. By the
1930s, agricultural wells had become a problem for the valley's cities.
A 1921 engineering report warned of the falling water table and its
possible threat to farming and cities. Continual overdrafting of the
water supply led to subsidence---the sinking of surface land as the
emptied aquifers compressed under the weight of the earth above
them---which led to ruptured well casings, broken water lines, damage to
building foundations, and made well-pumping more expensive for farmers
as their wells had to be sunk deeper to reach the lowered water tables.
Even worse, traces of salt from the San Francisco Bay began appearing in
the aquifers, another result of sinking land reshaping the underground
water system. Salty water was useless for irrigation and unable to be
used for drinking water.[^31] Realizing that the underground waters
could run dry, policymakers looked to the examples of the Hetch Hetchy
and Owens Valley reservoirs. Herbert C. Jones, an attorney from Stanford
and member of the State Senate elected as Progressive Republican in
1913, began taking steps to remedy the valley's growing water problem.
Voters twice rejected bond measures to begin construction of percolation
ponds and dam projects to help trap and funnel waters back into the
underground aquifers. In 1929, Jones introduced a new bill that
attempted to placate voters by setting up a water district that would
lack the power of provisioning bonds to pay for water projects. The bill
met the approval of wary voters, and the Jones Act helped establish the
Santa Clara Valley Water Conservation District (SCVWCD) in 1930 with the
mandate to help solve the valley's growing water problems. By the end of
the 1930s, SCVWCD constructed six new dams.[^32] The Valley's cities
also contracted with existing water infrastructure, including private
water suppliers and the Hetch Hetchy, to supply the growing farms and
cities with enough resources.[^33]

The Valley's climate and soil shaped what farmers chose to grow. While a
semiarid environment with little rainfall outside the winter months of
November through March, farmers could enjoy a consistent and long
growing season. The Valley's mountains prevented serious frosts,
protected the valley from harsh winds, and storms of any sort were rare.
The alluvial soils of the Valley were rich with nutrients. These
combined factors of climate and soil allowed farmers to determine which
crops were best suited to the area. While the Spanish tended to use most
of the Valley for ranching, Americans overturned the Spanish ranching
culture by the 1860s and instead adopted dry wheat farming, oats,
barley, and other grains. By the 1870s wheat farming dominated the
Valley as farmers collected nearly 1.2 million bushels of wheat, an 872%
increase from twenty years earlier.[^34]

Yet while wheat became a major crop in the Valley, the introduction of
fruit would become the flora that would dramatically change the Valley
environment and culture. Just as wheat cultivation was reaching its
peak, fruit cultivation began to take root. Prune cultivation was
introduced in 1856, followed quickly by other fruit varieties. By 1888,
historian George Bancroft estimated that California shipped 54 million
pounds of fresh fruit, 39 million pounds of canned fruit, and 20 million
pounds of dried fruit to the East Coast.[^35] By 1915 the Santa Clara
Valley alone produced one-third of the world's prune crop as well as
significant amounts of walnuts and apricots. Just before the outbreak of
World War II, California supplied over half of the world's dried
prunes.[^36]

Before long, the emergence of the canning industry would alter the
agricultural landscape further. In 1871, Dr. James Dawson began canning
surplus peaches and pears, jump-starting what would become a massive
cannery industry that dominated the Valley's landscape until World War
II.[^37] By 1872 San Jose boasted two large canneries.[^38] The growing
of fruits in Santa Clara Valley along with the cultivation of sugar
beets, grapes, and fruit elsewhere in California occurred just as the
wheat fields began to fall in favor. Along with advancements in
transportation methods including the completion of the transcontinental
railroad in 1869 and refrigerated rail cars in 1888, fruit and vegetable
production became economically viable. On the verge of the Great
Depression, thirty-eight canneries operated in Santa Clara County. The
California canneries of Del Monte, the California Packing Corporation
(Calpak), Hunt's, Richmond-Case, Bayside Canning Company, Precita
Canning Company, and the Garden City Canning Company all operated in
Santa Clara County by the 1920s. By the middle of the twentieth century,
California produced more canned fruits and vegetables than any other
state.[^39]

![Female cannery workers, 1920. Bancroft Library, University of California-Berkeley.](figures/women-canneries.jpg)

Aiding the transition to fruit were new systems for food preparation,
distribution, shipping, and financing. The completion of a railroad
between San Francisco and San Jose in 1864 helped with the shipping of
goods out of the agricultural towns of the Valley to the ports in San
Francisco. Adding to fruit's viability, the new Oceanic Steamship
Company began importing raw sugar and other products from Hawaii. Claus
Spreckle's huge sugar refinery build along 23rd Street in San Francisco
helped refine the sugar into a cannery product. Fruit growers also
benefited from the invention of an orchard spray pump, created by John
Bean of Los Gatos. The invention allowed fruit growers to combat pests
and insects more easily. Bean's success allowed him to found the Food
Machinery and Chemical Corporation in San Jose. [^40]

The orchard landscape introduced new myths to the Valley. As historian
Cecelia Tsu notes, by the 1880s California boosters promoted "orchard
fruit growing as one of the most idyllic incarnations of the family farm
ideal, and the Santa Clara Valley as the finest location to live out
this agrarian dream."[^41] The San Jose Chamber of Commerce boasted in
1910 that the "Santa Clara Valley is literally the most fruitful valley
in the world," growing "the *very best*" fruits, and took pride in "our
magnificent roads, the best of country highways, our fine fruits, our
possibilities in home making, our universities, schools, churches,
transportation facilities, our 'best ever' climate" in transforming the
Valley into a successful agricultural center.[^42] As acreage devoted to
fruit cultivation grew, so did the myths.[^43]

Portions of the garden myth trace themselves to the waterscape, but also
to the great expanse of trees that once occupied the flatlands and
valley hillsides. Oak trees once dotted the flatlands of the Santa Clara
Valley and were uniquely adapted to survive both the arid climate and
human influences. Fires, set by Ohlone and by storms, led oaks to adapt
to burnings through thicker barks and an ability to sprout new growth
from root systems. Fires also released new nutrients into the soils,
allowing the hardier oak saplings to take advantage of the lack of
competition for fresh nutrients.[^44] "What a sight it was to behold all
those old oaks and majestic sycamores," wrote Amaury Mars during his
visit to Santa Clara Valley in 1901.[^45] The oaks were a source of
attraction for the rural lifestyle painted by the region's boosters.
"The valley is a park," claimed the San Jose Chamber of Commerce in
1910, "originally dotted with magnificent oaks." Left unsaid by the
twentieth century was the near-elimination of oaks from the valley
floor.[^46]

The shift from ranching to farming also led to widespread clearcutting
of trees. Eager to clear the land for maximum availability of
cultivation, farmers cut down oak woodlands and willow groves, filled
vernal pools, and reclaimed salt marshes to expand the amount of land
available for farming. The cutting of trees also formed a core business
for timber interests. Returning Gold Rush seekers often went into the
lumber business rather than farming. By 1857 twelve sawmills were active
in Santa Clara Valley. Groves and woodlands were quickly cleared and
transformed into land for cultivation.[^47] When aspiring homesteader
Bernard Reid moved to Santa Clara in 1851, he noted that most wood for
fuel was hauled in from three miles away. There was no nearby lumber
available for the town.[^48] As oak woodlands disappeared from the
Valley floor, timbermen went into the hills for the redwoods. By the
1880s, much of the accessible forests in the Santa Cruz Mountains were
logged.[^49]

Cattle ranching, wheat and grain production, and quicksilver mining
flourished in the Valley in the late nineteenth century prior to the
Valley becoming "one vast orchard."[^50] By the end of the nineteenth
century, fruit production had surpassed all other agricultural, mining,
and timbering activity. The growth of Silicon Valley occurred upon some
of California's most fertile lands. A survey by the U.S. Department of
Agriculture designated 400 square kilometers---32 percent---of Santa
Clara County as Class 1 land, the highest ranking possible for the
cultivation of fruits and vegetables. Water systems flowing into the
valley carved out rich alluvial fans in the Valley. Below topsoil
loam---in some places measuring forty feet deep---are gravel and clay
freshwater aquifers, which nineteenth century farmers reached with
artesian wells that provided a consistent supply of fresh water.[^51]
Santa Clara Valley farms remained relatively small. In 1900, the typical
farm was under fifty acres; in 1920, the average farm size was forty
acres and dropped to thirty-two acres by 1950.[^52] Agricultural
activity by the 1940s witnessed around 6,000 farms in the Valley, mostly
family--run operations that totaled around 132,000 acres and some eight
million cherry, apricot, and pear trees.[^53] By the end of the
nineteenth century, as the region became a prominent agricultural
producer, *Sunset* magazine writers labeled it "The Valley of Heart's
Delight" and "The Delectable Valley" due to its reputation as a major
fruit producer. The production of prunes, walnuts, and apricots, the
economic staples of the Valley, were consumed all over the world.[^54]
As late as the 1950s, canneries processed more than thirty percent of
the state's crop of fruit and vegetables. Although the valley itself
only produced a small portion of the crop, the facilities for canning,
drying, and freezing were located near rail, highway, and water routes
in the South Bay.[^55]

\thoughtbreak{The agrarian culture that had come to dominate} the Valley
was exalted not only for its remarkable productivity but also for its
aesthetics and promise of the "good life." When John Muir passed through
the Valley in the spring of 1872, he remarked that the Santa Clara
Valley's climate was "the best we ever enjoyed."[^56] The French writer
Amaury Mars agreed. When he visited the Santa Clara Valley in 1901, he
remarked that "no spot in the world has Nature been more lavish of her
gifts. The heat is never oppressive nor the cold severe; there is never
too much moisture, while thunder storms and, above all, cyclones are
altogether unknown here."[^57] The valley's landscape offered a
compelling tale: a veritable garden; indeed, the Garden of the World.
The story was uncomplicated, and in its simplicity it masked historical
realities of the landscape.

Key to Santa Clara Valley resident's understanding of themselves was the
"nature" they had inherited. Above all, the orchards symbolized the
Valley as a paradise on earth. Journalist Bayard Taylor, arriving in
California in 1849, reported on "the vast and wonderful landscape" of
the Santa Clara Valley. He wrote of

> the soft cloudless sky---the balmy atmosphere---the mountain ranges on
> either hand, stretching far before me until they vanished in a purple
> haze---the silica sweep of the plain, with its islands and shores of
> dark-greek oak, and the picturesque variety of animal life on all
> sides, combined to form a landscape which I may have seen equaled but
> never surpassed.[^58]

\noindent Gold rush seeker Bernard Reid wrote in a letter to his family
that the Valley "was far preferable to any spot I had before seen in
California," describing the Valley as "this Italy and garden spot of
All-America---of singing birds, and the grassy sward, and balmy air, and
the sunny sky."[^59] Visitors to the Valley celebrated the expanse of
trees, wild flowers, animals, and rural pastoralism of the Valley.[^60]

Such thinking found its way into promotional material as well. The San
Jose Board of Trade asked rhetorically in 1895, "What will not thrive in
the utmost prodigality? . . . Come let us show you hundreds of acres in
constant bearing."[^61] The San Jose Chamber of Commerce boasted that
the valley had the "largest fruit canneries in the world; largest fruit
packing houses in the world; largest fruit drying ground in the world."
The Chamber beckoned farmers from the Midwest and Northeast, where
climate and frosts could threaten their crops. Not so in Santa Clara
Valley, where sunshine was more common than cloudy skies. Chamber
advertisements claimed 245 clear days and only a handful of rainy or
cloudy days.[^62] The climate made for perfect farming conditions.
"Without any days so cold as the colder days of an Illinois April, it
has no days so warm as the warmer days of an Illinois June," the Chamber
assured readers in 1910.[^63] The Valley presented farmers with a
seemingly assured profit and almost no risk thanks to the climate in
which they could grow their produce.

![Fruit drying trays, ca. 1920--1930. California Room, San Jose Public Library.](figures/drying-trays.png)

Promotional material also placed the productivity of the land against a
narrative of a Spanish and Mexican past. American promotional literature
avoided distinctions among peoples, casting the Spanish, Mexican, and
Indian history of the Valley together as a "mission era" where land went
underutilized until Anglo-Americans introduced an exceptional period of
fruit production. Spanish and Mexicans were cast as "content to eat,
sleep, ride horseback and roll cigarettes" while the land went unused,
against the hard-working Anglo-American farmers raising orchards and who
improved the land for maximum productivity.[^64] Orchards replaced adobe
as a defining feature of the Valley. While the Spanish names remained on
the Valley's landscape like the city names "Santa Clara," "Palo Alto,"
and "San Jose," Anglo-American promoters had recast the landscape in
their view. When botanist William Brewer passed through the Valley in
1861 he remarked that Americans were already showing signs of progress.
The Valley, he noted, was "all . . . enclosed, in farms, and under good
cultivation. Farmhouses, orchards, etc., give it an *American* look . .
. [The valley] is perhaps twelve or fourteen miles wide at San Jose, an
almost perfect plain, very fertile, a perfect garden, and much of it in
higher cultivation than any other part of California."[^65] Promoters
anticipated that newcomers would be unfamiliar with the pronunciation of
Spanish names and instructed Anglo-Americans on pronunciation to clarify
that "San Jose" was pronounced "San Hosay."[^66]

In addition to copious amounts of water and its attendant problems noted
above, the orchards generated tremendous levels of waste. Much of the
waste came in the form of cannery effluence. To aid the canneries in
their production, San Jose especially became a willing partner.
Beginning in the 1870s the small farm town began construction of a storm
and sewage system that would funnel wastes away from the city. Much of
the waste found itself dumped into the San Francisco Bay. While the
system seemed to effectively deal with the problem of waste in the city,
it had the effect of upsetting the Bay's ecosystems. The dumping of the
city's waste into the Bay all but destroyed the clam and shrimp
industries as the contamination of water caused steadily-increasing
dieoffs that made the raising and harvesting of molluscan fisheries
unprofitable.[^67]

The orchards introduced additional modifications to the environment. In
the late 1880s, the invention of a spray pump by John Bean of Los Gatos
allowed growers to control pests and insects more easily.[^68] The
orchards also clouded the skies with soot. Orchardists employed the use
of smudgepots---a device comprised of a basin that held kerosene and a
chimney-like pipe emerging roughly five feet high---to warm orchard
fields and prevent frosts from damaging fruits. Usually lit and burned
through the duration of the night, the smudgepots cast smoke and oily
soot into the air. Californians recalled waking up after cool nights to
find themselves covered in an oily film from the kerosene burners, and
children were loathe to arrive at school with "smudge face."[^69]

What historian Mark Fiege concluded for nineteenth-century Idaho---that
Americans crafted a story of "pioneers [who] conquered the howling
wilderness and transformed it into beautiful, productive fields and
farms"---could be equally applied to the Santa Clara Valley.[^70] The
story was a powerful one in American culture. The land was one of Eden,
and the garden myth that emerged in the nineteenth century would
maintain a powerful grip on the human imposition of ideas onto nature.
Americans viewed the valley through the lens of capitalizing on the
"prodigal gifts of nature," picturing straight plots of reclaimed land
held by private-property owning farmers who toiled to raise the best
fruit in the world. Fruit stood at the core of life in the Santa Clara
Valley and in many ways came to define the market towns. In other words,
the horticulture economy was not simply an accident of topography but
came from culture as well. Promoters of the Valley crafted a narrative
of a land laid fallow under the hands of Indians and Spanish transformed
into a garden by Americans. Emphasizing conquest, both over people and
over nature, the narrative crafted a vision of the Valley put to better
use by the ingenuity and industry of Americans. City and nature were
culturally intertwined.

Over time, city leaders valued the orchards, recognizing their
importance in crafting an image of the Valley that would draw people to
the towns. Irrigation, roads, sewers, railroads, cheap land, and
consistently-productive farms became hallmarks of promotional literature
all revolving around the orchard trees. The trees were admired but also
celebrated for the significant income it provided communities. [^71]

Americans admired their handiwork on the land. In 1894 San Jose held its
first agricultural festival at Agricultural Park that featured
appearances by Arizona Charlie's troupe, Doc Goodwin's horse riders,
fireworks, and dancing, to celebrate the agricultural bounty of the
Valley. By the early 1900s Saratoga advertised "blossom week" hosted by
the Santa Clara County Improvement Club where visitors flocked to the
valley to view orchards in full bloom. Such pilgrimages to nature
continued well into the late 1950s, when residents and visitors could
take part of "Blossom Tours" throughout the Valley that allowed them to
view fruit trees in full bloom at various times of the year.[^72]

The exceptional growing climate, fertile soil, and plentiful water from
artesian wells allowed farmers to transform the landscape into the fruit
capital it would be known as worldwide. By the 1920s, Santa Clara Valley
led the state in fruit production, drying, canning, and packing,
providing a range of products such as cherries, prunes, apricots, pears,
peaches, plums, and apples. By 1930, Santa Clara County produced between
one-third to one-half of the world's prune supply.[^73] The cultivation
and processing of apricots, prunes, pears, and cherries became staples
on the horticulture landscape.[^74] Fruit trees produced a canopy of
pink and white blossoms along with orange California poppies and other
native wildflowers that bloomed on the hillsides. The blooming seasons
were popular early in the twentieth century as visitors flocked to the
area to behold the orchards in full bloom, along with farmhouses, berry
patches, vegetable gardens, and pastures.[^75] Little wonder why the
Santa Clara Valley boosters advertised the area as "nearest Paradise"
and "the best spot in the whole earth," a place where "the Eden of vine
and tree" was a "God-favored spot" and "God's favorite valley."[^76]

The pre-World War II spatial practices that configured Santa Clara
Valley were products of the agricultural economy. By the twentieth
century, the Santa Clara Valley landscape became more than just the
earth. Collections of laws, institutions, attitudes, infrastructure, and
policies were tied to the natural world of water, soil, plants, and
animals. City promoters in the nineteenth century crafted an identity of
the Valley around its climate, environmental amenities, and
productivity, in the process embedding cultural values into perceptions
of the valley while farmers simultaneously grew prodigious orchards. Yet
the Valley had become an overburdened landscape through the demands
placed on its environment. Aquifers ran dry, forests were clear-cut,
natural flora crowded out, lacked state and national parks until the
mid-twentieth century. As industrialization and urbanization take off in
the twentieth century, the county becomes a groundswell for
environmentalism. All of these activities had great consequences on the
region's people and environment, and each defined landscape greatly
overlapped one another leading to strenuous debates about how each
landscape affected the others.

\thoughtbreak{The Valley distinguished itself in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries}
as a space for agricultural productivity. The monumental shifts in the
Valley economy came with war and began transforming the industrial
activity of Santa Clara Valley towards high technology well before the
moniker Silicon Valley became a household term. The path between
agriculture and high technology may not seem straightforward, but the
Valley's history as an agricultural center helped shape its twentieth
century. As the next chapter demonstrates, the choice of water projects
and planning, built originally for the purpose of supporting
agriculture, would come to serve the metropolitan growth after World War
II.

The orchards themselves would come to shape suburban sprawl. The image
of a home in the countryside, Chapter 2 also illustrates, drew newcomers
and oldtimers of Santa Clara Valley alike further and further away from
downtowns in order to participate in recreation and suburban
domesticity. Throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, families moved into
unincorporated land to be near nature. As downtowns declined, the
suburbs rapidly expanded as federal tax policies and incentives
encouraged businesses, malls, and subdivisions to locate new
construction outside city cores. Industrial recruitment likewise used
the countryside lifestyle to attract new industries. "Their scientists
liked living there . . . attracted, in part, by the region's 'good
life'," Richard Rowe wrote in a study of open space and agriculture in
Santa Clara County. But Rowe worried that these amenities would
disappear in the twentieth century. "Today's open space appears headed
for tomorrow's subdivision. With the loss of these open spaces the
county will lose much of its charm."[^77]

The orchards found expression on the landscape of the Valley's
infrastructure. Mid-twentieth century promoters did not forget the
agricultural heritage of the Valley, giving or maintaining street names
such as "Blossom Hill," "Cherry," "Apricot," "Hillsdale," "Willow Glen,"
and "Cherrydale" that expressed a landscape culturally tied to
agriculture. Homebuilders promoted their subdivisions as "country-side
living" next to orchards. The agricultural past became a tool for the
marketability of homes. The productivity of land for farming became
valued differently, not as space that was productive but as space fit
for suburban homes in the garden. The Garden of the World remained, but
became cast as the suburban dream.

While these events would come later in the postwar period, the
infrastructure and culture of agriculture---roads, sewers, the
countryside---allowed a condition where rapid urbanization could be
supported and encouraged. The economic and political demands allowed
these spaces to take shape and contributed profoundly to the process of
Silicon Valley's postwar urbanization. The Santa Clara County underwent
a definition of a particular kind of place that revolved around its
relationship to the environment. The cultural and structural creation of
this Eden by nineteenth century boosters and twentieth century promoters
detailed a landscape put to the service of agricultural production. That
agricultural landscape would be shed beginning in the mid-twentieth
century. The agricultural past allowed cities like Santa Clara to boast
of "THE GOOD LIFE" owing itself to the "blooming orchard trees,"
"relaxed outdoor living," and the "heritage and legacy of the early
Franciscan padres."[^78] The same culture of nature-as-sublime is what
led Wallace Stegner to conclude that the "original sin came with the
Spaniards" before Americans planted their pear, peach, cherry, prune,
and apricot trees, the "forerunners of the golden age."[^79] But the
agricultural past would be shed and reshaped, and through that process
the modern Santa Clara Valley took shape.
