Journalist Leonard Downie could scarcely find nature in Silicon Valley.
Visiting San Jose in the early 1970s, he concluded that the only
remaining open space existed along the "carefully tended and regularly
watered greenery along the shoulders of the county's many freeways." The
Santa Clara Valley had become defined by the clusters of poorly-built
and quickly constructed homes, traffic that had given the air a
"mustard-colored haze," and urban space so compact that there existed no
"open spaces, parks or even sidewalks." Downie blamed poor planning and
greed for the valley's urban problems, citing a study that found
residential density could be maintained near 1973 levels in just thirty
square miles that could have saved miles of open space and orchards.
Santa Clara County, Downie concluded, had become a "jigsaw puzzle of intertwined
suburbs" and the land "systematically ravaged" by "speculators,
developers, other entrepreneurs and homebuyers."^[Leonard Downie, Jr.,
"A Misplanned Suburb," *Washington Post*, December 30, 1973.]

Downie was not alone in questioning the value of urban growth at the 
expense of disappearing open space. After a decade-long boom that saw 
Bay Area cities sprawl throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, activists 
began promoting the protection of open space open space for recreation, 
aesthetics, and health. All along the Peninsula, advocates argued for 
new restrictions on city growth and the protection of greenbelts, public 
parks, and wilderness areas. "Already we have filled the San Francisco 
basin with housing, industry, airfields, and highways, from the tops of 
the hills to the edge of the water," wrote Raymond Desmann. If the 
process proceeded, Dasmann feared a "gigantic, disorganized metropolis" 
"engulfing farm and forest, marsh and pasture with no end in 
sight."^[Dasmann, *The Destruction of California*, 19.] Debates over 
open space in Santa Clara Valley followed three branches. The first 
emerged among expert urban planners and residential activists, who 
relied on professionals to form a critique of poor urban planning and 
the loss of natural landscapes. The second came from anti-growth and 
no-growth advocates who urged tightened restrictions on the places that 
cities were allowed to expand. Finally, another branch of activists 
focused their argument around issues of recreation. Together, these 
activists shared a common language---using terms such as "beauty," 
"wilderness," "ecology"---but used that vocabulary to defend and define 
different goals. The advocates for open space revealed a clash between 
competing political ideas and urban priorities, and the very definition 
of "nature" sat at the middle of the conflict.

## LAFCO Establishment and Regional Thinking

## Saving Open Space for the Cost of Wine and Bread

Concerns about the increasing value of agricultural land and threat of 
urban sprawl led the state legislature to act. The California 
Legislature passed the Land Conservation Act in 1965.  Known as the 
Williamson Act, the state legislation ostensibly provided protections 
for open space and greenbelts. Under the Williamson Act, agricultural 
land had the option to be removed from markets by entering into a 
contract with county governments that restricted the land's use to 
agricultural uses for a minimum of ten years. In return, farmers enjoyed 
a tax benefit. County assessors valued the land at agricultural value 
rather than market value, allowing farmers to pay lower taxes on their 
land and, both parties hoped, allowed the land to remain agricultural 
perennially. Contracts were renewed annually unless notice for 
nonrenewal was given. An amendment to the Williamson Act in {YEAR} 
provided additional incentive to property owners by requiring value 
assessments at least twenty-five percent. By 1969, twenty-three counties 
in California placed more than two million acres of private land into 
the agricultural preserve.^[California Legislature, *Joint Committee on 
Open Space Land, Preliminary Report* (Sacramento, March 1969), 10; 
@brucebiggs1975landuse, 1--13; @snyder1966landuse, 1306--1313; 
@walker2007countrycity, 43. See also @brosnan2010napa, 36.]

Despite the availability of state law to control land use, the law fell 
short of its intended goals in Santa Clara County. Farmers, after all, 
still had the voluntary option of selling their land at some point in 
the future. The Williamson Act contained the potential for perpetual 
agricultural reserves under its renewable ten-year contracts, but in 
reality farmers often bowed to market pressures. Faced with shrinking 
agricultural land, citizens began seeking alternative and long-term 
methods for sustaining the presence of open space throughout the 
Peninsula. Community organizing continued to shape the local policies 
guiding land use with an increasing focus on recreation and public 
lands. An alliance of residents calling themselves Citizens for Regional 
Recreation and Parks (CRRP) formed in June 1958 with the intent to 
pressure regional government to consider the issue of public open 
spaces. Made up of conservationists, planning officials, and university 
professors, CRRP began building networks among their membership to share 
information, develop a policy on regional conservation, and support 
educational programs.^[@kent1970openspace, 69.] In 1968, the 
organization filed for nonprofit, tax-exempt status and renamed 
themselves People for Open Space (POS). Their new status as nonprofit 
allowed them to pursue a \$59,000 Ford Foundation grant to examine the 
economic impact of open space in the Bay Area.^[@kent1970openspace, 74; 
"Ideas for Discussion with Ford Foundation," November 19, 1968, Folder 
4, Carton 2, California Tomorrow Records, California Historical 
Society.] Completed in 1969 and published as both a main report and as a 
summary pamphlet, POS laid out a vision for Peninsula open space that 
fulfilled their desire to guide places against urban expansion.

People for Open Space applauded the Williamson Act, but remained 
skeptical about its implementation. Finding that "very little high 
quality agricultural land has been conserved" and concerned about the 
lack of a "guarantee of permanence," they conclude that the voluntary 
contracts are ultimately an unsatisfactory solution to open space 
preservation.^[People for Open Space, "The Case for Open Space," report, 
7, Folder 4 People for Open Space, Carton 2, California Tomorrow 
Records, California Historical Society.] A more desirable action was for 
a regional governmental body to purchase all available open space for 
preservation. Such a plan, they argued, would hardly place a financial 
burden onto Bay Area residents. In assessing the costs of such a program 
that factored in land value and the offsetting of expenses that would 
come from providing urban services to densely-populated areas versus 
sprawling cities, People for Open Space estimated that the net costs for 
each person in the Bay Area would amount to only \$2 to \$3 dollars per 
year---"about the cost of a good bottle of California wine and a loaf of 
sourdough French bread."^[People for Open Space, "The Case for Open 
Space," report, 10, Folder 4 People for Open Space, Carton 2, California 
Tomorrow Records, California Historical Society. See also Association of 
Bay Area Governments, *Regional Open Space Element*, Supplemental Report 
RP-3, (Berkeley, October 1969), 9--10.] 

POS remained active in open space protections throughout the 1970s, 
pioneering the establishment of the Mid-Peninsula Open Space District in 
1972 as well as various conservation programs that protected the Suisan 
Marsh, agricultural preserves in Napa Valley, and the conservation 
of Angel Island State Park.

## Sprawl Brawl

San Jose's drive for growth began to slow in the early 1960s as 
homeowners in the suburban fringes of the city began opposing growth 
interests. In 1962, voters elected the first candidate to oppose growth 
in the city. Virginia Shaffer was a Republican from {DETAIL} who 
rose to office representing the interests of homeowners, including being 
the only city council member opposing consolidation with Alviso. Council 
member Pace attempted to put homeowners at ease, saying that "I'm not 
denying it will cost some money but it has an awful lot of promise." But 
new interests were starting to guide ideas about the city's progress. 

By 1970, the brakes were firmly pressed. Although San Jose's growth 
control measures never became quite as strident as those pursued in the 
northern peninsula cities of Menlo Park, Palo Alto, and Atherton, 
homeowners began demanding new policies to protect their natural views. 
Following the nation-wide trend in establishing land use controls to 
slow urban growth, only a single Bay Area town had growth control laws 
in 1972 but by 1975 thirty-one had established new regulations. 

San Jose followed the trend. One method of growth control came in the 
form of zoning for residential density. The City reduced residential 
density throughout the city from twelve to eighteen housing units per 
acre to six to eight units. New policies also required that no new 
development could be permitted until developers submitted environmental 
impact statements that specified how they would handle storm runoff, 
maintain open space, ensure the availability of city infrastructure, and 
accessible schools.^[Santa Clara County Planning Policy Committee, 
*Zoning and Housing* (San Jose: Santa Clara County Planning Department, 
1970); Santa Clara County Planning Policy Committee, "Urban 
Development/Open Space Plan for Santa Clara County, 1973-1978" (Santa 
Clara County Planning Department, n.d.), Box 4, Folder 96, League of 
Women Voters, San Jose/Santa Clara Chapter Records, San Jose State 
University Library Special Collections and Archives; Social Planning

Department, "Profile '70: A Socio-Economic Data Book for Santa Clara 
County"; San Jose City Planning Commission, Master Plan of the City of 
San Jose; San Jose City Planning Commission, *1981 Annual Review: The 
General Plan, List of Potential Land Use/Transportation Diagram and Text 
Amendments*; "General Plan Amendment Report, 1981 Annual Review, Text 
Amendments, Number 139", 1981, Box 3, Folder 50, League of Women Voters,

Jose: City of San Jose, July 16, 1981), Box 4, Folder 94, League of 
Women Voters, San Jose/Santa Clara Chapter Records, San Jose State 
University Library Special Collections and Archives.]. In 1973, San Jose 
voters passed Measure B that prevented new residential development until 
adequate school space was provided for future residents.^[Kenneth T.  
Rosen and Lawrence F. Katz, "Growth Management and Land Use Controls: 
The San Francisco Bay Area Experience," *Real Estate Economics* 9, no. 4 
(December 1981): 332--333.] 

Many of these regulations, however, had the unintended affect of 
offloading the costs of development to consumers and made low- and 
mid-size developments unprofitable. In response, developers began 
building pricier housing that could only be purchased by high-income 
residents.^[Rosen and Katz, "Growth Management and Land Use Controls: 
The San Francisco Bay Area Experience," 328-331.] 

Concerns about the environmental impact of growth moved to the forefront 
of the mayoral campaign between Janet Gray Hayes and Al Garza in 1974. 
The two platforms of the candidates revolved centrally around urban 
growth and environmental issues.
