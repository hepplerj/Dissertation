<!--ARGUMENT: As "nature" receded underneath asphalt, Bay Area environmentalists
sought to create places for "nature" through open space, etc.

enough, locals took things into their own hands (ordinances, activism)

Journalist Leonard Downie could scarcely find nature in Silicon Valley.
Visiting San Jose in the early 1970s, he concluded that the only
remaining open space existed along the "carefully tended and regularly
watered greenery along the shoulders of the county's many freeways." The
Santa Clara Valley had become defined by the clusters of poorly-built
and quickly constructed homes, traffic that had given the air a
"mustard-colored haze," and urban space so compact that there existed no
"open spaces, parks or even sidewalks." Downie blamed poor planning and
greed for the valley's urban problems, citing a study that found
residential density could be maintained near 1973 levels in just thirty
square miles that could have saved miles of open space and orchards.
Santa Clara County, Downie concluded, had become a "jigsaw puzzle of intertwined
suburbs" and the land "systematically ravaged" by "speculators,
developers, other entrepreneurs and homebuyers."^[Leonard Downie, Jr.,
"A Misplanned Suburb," *Washington Post*, December 30, 1973.]

Downie was not alone in questioning the value of urban growth at the 
expense of disappearing open space. After a decade-long boom that saw 
Bay Area cities sprawl throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, activists 
began promoting the protection of open space open space for recreation, 
aesthetics, and health. All along the Peninsula, advocates argued for 
new restrictions on city growth and the protection of greenbelts, public 
parks, and wilderness areas. "Already we have filled the San Francisco 
basin with housing, industry, airfields, and highways, from the tops of 
the hills to the edge of the water," wrote Raymond Desmann. If the 
process proceeded, Dasmann feared a "gigantic, disorganized metropolis" 
"engulfing farm and forest, marsh and pasture with no end in 
sight."^[Dasmann, *The Destruction of California*, 19.] Debates over 
open space in Santa Clara Valley followed three branches. The first 
emerged among expert urban planners and residential activists, who 
relied on professionals to form a critique of poor urban planning and 
the loss of natural landscapes. The second came from anti-growth and 
no-growth advocates who urged tightened restrictions on the places that 
cities were allowed to expand. Finally, another branch of activists 
focused their argument around issues of recreation. Together, these 
activists shared a common language---using terms such as "beauty," 
"wilderness," "ecology"---but used that vocabulary to defend and define 
different goals. The advocates for open space revealed a clash between 
competing political ideas and urban priorities, and the very definition 
of "nature" sat at the middle of the conflict.

The debate over the protection of open space played out across the 
United States. 

## Saving Open Space for the Cost of Wine and Bread

Concerns about the increasing value of agricultural land and threat of 
urban sprawl led the state legislature to act. The California 
Legislature passed the Land Conservation Act in 1965.  Known as the 
Williamson Act, the state legislation ostensibly provided protections 
for open space and greenbelts. Under the Williamson Act, agricultural 
land had the option to be removed from markets by entering into a 
contract with county governments that restricted the land's use to 
agricultural uses for a minimum of ten years. In return, farmers enjoyed 
a tax benefit. County assessors valued the land at agricultural value 
rather than market value, allowing farmers to pay lower taxes on their 
land and, both parties hoped, allowed the land to remain agricultural 
perennially. Contracts were renewed annually unless notice for 
nonrenewal was given. An amendment to the Williamson Act in {YEAR} 
provided additional incentive to property owners by requiring value 
assessments at least twenty-five percent. By 1969, twenty-three counties 
in California placed more than two million acres of private land into 
the agricultural preserve.^[California Legislature, *Joint Committee on 
Open Space Land, Preliminary Report* (Sacramento, March 1969), 10; 
Hutchinson and Blummer, "The Williamson Act," 2--4, 7--11; 
@brucebiggs1975landuse, 1--13; @snyder1966landuse, 1306--1313; 
@walker2007countrycity, 43.]

Santa Clara County became the example. In 1959, the county could boast 
of 73,000 acres of fruit and nut crops, which dwindled to just 1,900 by 
1992.^[*California Fruit and Nut Acreage*, 1959 report, 5, and 1992 
report, 10; @brosnan2010napa, 36.] Under the Williamson Act, the 
county placed nearly {DETAIL} acres into the agricultural preserve 
by 1969. 

Despite the availability of state law to control land use, the law fell 
short of its intended goals in Santa Clara County. Farmers, after all, 
still had the voluntary option of selling their land at some point in 
the future. The Williamson Act contained the potential for perpetual 
agricultural reserves under its renewable ten-year contracts, but in 
reality farmers often bowed to market pressures. Faced with shrinking 
agricultural land, citizens began seeking alternative and long-term 
methods for sustaining the presence of open space throughout the 
Peninsula. Community organizing continued to shape the local policies 
guiding land use with an increasing focus on recreation and public 
lands. An alliance of residents calling themselves Citizens for Regional 
Recreation and Parks (CRRP) formed in June 1958 with the intent to 
pressure regional government to consider the issue of public open 
spaces. Made up of conservationists, planning officials, and university 
professors, CRRP began building networks among their membership to share 
information, develop a policy on regional conservation, and support 
educational programs.^[@kent1970openspace, 69.] In 1968, the 
organization filed for nonprofit, tax-exempt status and renamed 
themselves People for Open Space (POS). Their new status as nonprofit 
allowed them to pursue a \$59,000 Ford Foundation grant to examine the 
economic impact of open space in the Bay Area.^[@kent1970openspace, 74; 
"Ideas for Discussion with Ford Foundation," November 19, 1968, Folder 
4, Carton 2, California Tomorrow Records, California Historical 
Society.] Completed in 1969 and published as both a main report and as a 
summary pamphlet, POS laid out a vision for Peninsula open space that 
fulfilled their desire to guide places against urban expansion.

People for Open Space applauded the Williamson Act, but remained 
skeptical about its implementation. Finding that "very little high 
quality agricultural land has been conserved" and concerned about the 
lack of a "guarantee of permanence," they conclude that the voluntary 
contracts are ultimately an unsatisfactory solution to open space 
preservation.^[People for Open Space, "The Case for Open Space," report, 
7, Folder 4 People for Open Space, Carton 2, California Tomorrow 
Records, California Historical Society.]

In assessing the costs of such a program, People for Open Space 
estimated that the net costs for each person in the Bay Area would 
amount to only \$2 to \$3 dollars per year---"about the cost of a good 
bottle of California wine and a loaf of sourdough French bread."^[People 
for Open Space, "The Case for Open Space," report, 10, Folder 4 People 
for Open Space, Carton 2, California Tomorrow Records, California 
Historical Society.]

POS remained active in open space protections throughout the 1970s, 
pioneering the establishment of the Mid-Peninsula Open Space District in 
1972 as well as various conservation programs that protected the Suisan 
Marsh, agricultural preserves in Napa Valley, and the conservation 
of Angel Island State Park.
