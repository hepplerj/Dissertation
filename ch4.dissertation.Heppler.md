Journalist Leonard Downie could scarcely find nature in Santa Clara 
County. Visiting San Jose in the early 1970s, he concluded that the only 
remaining open space existed along the "carefully tended and regularly 
watered greenery along the shoulders of the county's many freeways." The 
Santa Clara Valley had become defined by the clusters of poorly-built 
and quickly constructed homes, traffic that had given the air a 
"mustard-colored haze," and urban space so compact that there existed no 
"open spaces, parks or even sidewalks." Downie blamed poor planning and 
greed for the valley's urban problems, citing a study that found 
residential density could be maintained near 1973 levels in just thirty 
square miles that could have saved miles of open space and orchards.  
Santa Clara County, Downie concluded, had become a "jigsaw puzzle of 
intertwined suburbs" and the land "systematically ravaged" by 
"speculators, developers, other entrepreneurs and homebuyers."^[Leonard 
Downie, Jr., "A Misplanned Suburb," *Washington Post*, December 30, 
1973.] Downie was not alone in questioning the value of urban growth at 
the expense of disappearing open space. After a decade-long boom that 
saw Bay Area cities sprawl throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, 
activists began promoting the protection of open space open space for 
recreation, aesthetics, and health. All along the Peninsula, advocates 
argued for new restrictions on city growth and the protection of 
greenbelts, public parks, and wilderness areas. "Already we have filled 
the San Francisco basin with housing, industry, airfields, and highways, 
from the tops of the hills to the edge of the water," wrote Raymond 
Dasmann, a Berkeley-trained biologist. If the process proceeded, Dasmann 
feared a "gigantic, disorganized metropolis" "engulfing farm and forest, 
marsh and pasture with no end in sight."^[Dasmann, *The Destruction of 
California*, 19.] 

This chapter traces the chronological contours of open space debates in 
Silicon Valley. Debates over open space in Santa Clara Valley roughly 
followed three branches. The first emerged among expert urban planners 
and residential activists, who relied on professionals to form a 
critique of poor urban planning and the loss of natural landscapes. In 
the process, they began crafting new zoning restrictions that required 
environmental impact studies and land-use regulations. The second came 
from anti-growth and no-growth advocates who urged tightened 
restrictions on the places that cities were allowed to expand.  
Simultaneously, elite suburbanites were challenged by communities forced 
to the margins of the suburbs---Chicanos, African Americans, Asian 
Americans---who formed their own critique of conservation at once apart 
and in conflict with California's mainstream environmental 
organizations. Finally, another branch of activists focused their 
argument around issues of recreation and the "best use" for land. 
Together, these activists shared a common language---using terms such as 
"beauty," "wilderness," "ecology"---but used that vocabulary to defend 
and define different goals. Environmental advocates revealed a 
clash between competing political ideas and urban priorities, and the 
very definition of "nature" sat at the middle of the conflict.

Though their reasons were varied, 

\thoughtbreak{The professionalization of environmentalism} began 
emerging by the late 1950s among a group of urban planners coming out of 
the University of California-Berkeley. They thought of the environment 
differently. Whereas the neighborhood activists defined their concerns 
around specific local concerns, the new wave of environmentalists urged 
policymakers and cities to think more regionally.

## Environment and the Threat of Deindustrialization

Environmental activists made a point to suggest that sprawl, loss of 
open space, smog, traffic, and other concerns would lead to industries 
deciding to relocate elsewhere. If boosters were wont to point to 
climate, space, and the landscape as a benefit for industry and its 
employees, environmentalists were quick to point out that threatening 
those benefits also meant industry would be less likely to come to the 
Bay Area. Business and cultural institutions that had come to the Bay 
Area because of its quality of life reputation, argued People for Open 
Space, "are here because of the quality of the physical environment. The 
Bay, the rolling hills, the wooded ridges, the beaches, the orchards and 
vineyards---all combine to provide an unmatched setting."^[People for 
Open Space, "The Case for Open Space," report (January 1969), Folder 4, 
Carton 2, Calif. Tomorrow records {DETAIL}.]

## East Side Environment

The Community Services Organization (CSO) held its first 
meeting in San Jose in 1952, hosted by Cesar Chavez. Chavez lived in 
the neighborhood known as Sal si Puedes ("Get out if you can"), a 
suburban barrio in East San Jose that served as home for many of the 
area's seasonal workers. Sal Si Puedes was overlooked by the City. The 
majority of the concerns at the first CSO meeting revolved around 
environmental issues: floods, polluted creeks cesspools that spread 
dysentery.^[Cesar Chavez, "The Organizer's Tale," *Ramparts*, July 1966; 
Levy, *Cesar Chavez*, 97--98; Ross, *Conquering Goliath* 3; Ross, "The 
Saga of Sal Si Puedes" 5.] The CSO became an expression of political 
power for barrio residents concerned about urban growth and its 
attendant problems. The urban transformations in East San Jose led to a 
new kind of environmental politics among barrio residents that engaged 
in electoral politics and led to widespread discussions about urban 
growth and its attendant environmental costs for the suburban colonia. 

Located in the neighborhood of Mayfair east of Highway 101, Sal si 
Puedes occupied the eastern edge of the neighborhood.^[Sal si Puedes no 
longer exists today. The original site of Sal si Puedes is now overlaid 
by Highway 680. The interchange between Highway 680 and Highways 101/280 
was completed in the 1970s.] Sal si Puedes had become a site of 
environmental concern for the city's Mexican American residents. By the 
early 1950s, Fred Ross wrote of the area's lack of sewers, cesspools 
that led to amoebic dysentery outbreaks, and muddy, flooding streets 
that occasionally left children unable to attend school.^[Ross, "The 
Saga of Sal Si Puedes," 3--6.] In the 1950s the residents of Sal si 
Puedes criticized the environmental hazards that had overtaken their 
community. In the first meeting of the CSO, residents took the 
opportunity to denounce "every rate, mosquito, cesspool, traffic hazard 
and flooded road" that had characterized the city.^[Ross, "The Saga of 
Sal si Puedes," {PG}.] 

The very name of the community became a rallying point for activists. 
Originally coined Sal si Puedes by Puerto Rican families who gave it the 
name due to its muddy streets that became filled with potholes in the 
winter rains. Residents continued to use the name because of its housing 
and socioeconomic problems.^[Clark, *Health in Mexican American 
Culture*, 35.]

Ross, Chavez, and others began organizing the community to act. Ross told members of the 
CSO meeting that election drives he helped organize in Los Angeles had 
helped bring streetlights, paved roads, and medical care to the barrio. 
East San Jose could achieve the same.^[Ross, "The Saga of Sal si 
Puedes," {PG}.] An 85-day registration drive managed to register 6,000 
Mexican American voters, a tactic that worked. City officials responded, 
bringing modern urban services to Sal si Puedes within months after the 
election drive. New public works systems to fix chronic flooding, 
clearing out cesspools, and paved roads were brought to the barrio. 
Packinghouses and canneries were forced to end dumping into the 
creek.^[Ross, "The Saga of Sal si Puedes," 16; Clark, *Health in the 
Mexican-American Culture*, 28.] 

Despite the city's attempts at connecting the barrios to urban services, 
such places were considered expendable. The City of San Jose saw the 
barrios as signs of decay. "Each segment of the city," the 1958 master 
plan noted, "has a natural cycle of growth---obsolescence and 
decay---and then renewal."^[San Jose City Planning Commission, *Master 
Plan of the City of San Jose*, 89.] The planning commission's map of 
blighted areas closely followed the city's barrios. The city, the 
commission warned, needed to pursue renewal programs to prevent blight 
from spreading so "that the vast private investment in our city will 
remain sound an continue to expand."^[Planning Commission, *Master 
Plan*, 94--95.] Renewal needed to "clear and rebuild areas that 
economically are not worth saving."^[Planning Commission, *Master Plan 
of the City of San Jose*, 89.] The suggestions for renewal aligned with 
the federal transportation program, which city officials turned to for 
helping in aiding demolition of blighted areas. Municipal planners began 
planning three interstate highways and an expressway through East Side. 
Highways 280 and 680 would shuffle traffic between northern and southern 
Santa Clara County.  Capitol Expressway skirted the eastern edge of the 
city. In the process of constructing the new highway system, many of the 
eastside barrios were demolished.^["Housing for Freeway Displace-ees," 
n.d., Box 5, Folder 19, Fred Ross Papers, Department of Special 
Collections, Stanford University Libraries, Stanford, California.] In 
response to the eradication of San Jose's barrios, many Mexican 
Americans moved to a central part of eastside, physically and 
symbolically separated from white communities by the freeway. This area 
of San Jose also became home to the city's federally-financed public 
housing projects. In 1966, the new San Jose Housing Authority began 
placing Mexican Americans into public housing in a regional already 
highly populated by Mexican Aemricans.^["Housing for Freeway 
Displace-ees"; "Sofia Mendoza Oral History," March 2, 1988, Chicano Oral 
History Collection, San Jose State University Library Special 
Collections and Archives. See also Grace Kubota and Stephen Manley, 
"Opening Brief of Appellants," n.d., *Ybarra v. San Jose*, Northern 
District of California, 276-98-009, RG 276, Box 27, National Archives

## Saving Open Space for the Cost of Wine and Bread

Concerns about the increasing value of agricultural land and threat of 
urban sprawl led the state legislature to act. The California 
Legislature passed the Land Conservation Act in 1965. Known as the 
Williamson Act, the state legislation ostensibly provided protections 
for open space and greenbelts. Under the Williamson Act, agricultural 
land had the option to be removed from markets by entering into a 
contract with county governments that restricted the land's use to 
agricultural uses for a minimum of ten years. In return, farmers enjoyed 
a tax benefit. County assessors valued the land at agricultural value 
rather than market value, allowing farmers to pay lower taxes on their 
land and, both parties hoped, allowed the land to remain agricultural 
perennially. Contracts were renewed annually unless notice for 
nonrenewal was given. An amendment to the Williamson Act in {YEAR} 
provided additional incentive to property owners by requiring value 
assessments at least twenty-five percent. By 1969, twenty-three counties 
in California placed more than two million acres of private land into 
the agricultural preserve.^[California Legislature, *Joint Committee on 
Open Space Land, Preliminary Report* (Sacramento, March 1969), 10; 
@brucebiggs1975landuse, 1--13; @snyder1966landuse, 1306--1313; 
@walker2007countrycity, 43. See also @brosnan2010napa, 36.]

Despite the availability of state law to control land use, the law fell 
short of its intended goals in Santa Clara County. Farmers, after all, 
still had the voluntary option of selling their land at some point in 
the future. The Williamson Act contained the potential for perpetual 
agricultural reserves under its renewable ten-year contracts, but in 
reality farmers often bowed to market pressures. Faced with shrinking 
agricultural land, citizens began seeking alternative and long-term 
methods for sustaining the presence of open space throughout the 
Peninsula. Community organizing continued to shape the local policies 
guiding land use with an increasing focus on recreation and public 
lands. An alliance of residents calling themselves Citizens for Regional 
Recreation and Parks (CRRP) formed in June 1958 with the intent to 
pressure regional government to consider the issue of public open 
spaces. Made up of conservationists, planning officials, and university 
professors, CRRP began building networks among their membership to share 
information, develop a policy on regional conservation, and support 
educational programs.^[@kent1970openspace, 69.] In 1968, the 
organization filed for nonprofit, tax-exempt status and renamed 
themselves People for Open Space (POS). Their new status as nonprofit 
allowed them to pursue a \$59,000 Ford Foundation grant to examine the 
economic impact of open space in the Bay Area.^[@kent1970openspace, 74; 
"Ideas for Discussion with Ford Foundation," November 19, 1968, Folder 
4, Carton 2, California Tomorrow Records, California Historical 
Society.] Completed in 1969 and published as both a main report and as a 
summary pamphlet, POS laid out a vision for Peninsula open space that 
fulfilled their desire to guide places against urban expansion.

People for Open Space applauded the Williamson Act, but remained 
skeptical about its implementation. Finding that "very little high 
quality agricultural land has been conserved" and concerned about the 
lack of a "guarantee of permanence," they conclude that the voluntary 
contracts are ultimately an unsatisfactory solution to open space 
preservation.^[People for Open Space, "The Case for Open Space," report, 
7, Folder 4 People for Open Space, Carton 2, California Tomorrow 
Records, California Historical Society.] A more desirable action was for 
a regional governmental body to purchase all available open space for 
preservation. Such a plan, they argued, would hardly place a financial 
burden onto Bay Area residents. In assessing the costs of such a program 
that factored in land value and the offsetting of expenses that would 
come from providing urban services to densely-populated areas versus 
sprawling cities, People for Open Space estimated that the net costs for 
each person in the Bay Area would amount to only \$2 to \$3 dollars per 
year---"about the cost of a good bottle of California wine and a loaf of 
sourdough French bread."^[People for Open Space, "The Case for Open 
Space," report, 10, Folder 4 People for Open Space, Carton 2, California 
Tomorrow Records, California Historical Society. See also Association of 
Bay Area Governments, *Regional Open Space Element*, Supplemental Report 
RP-3, (Berkeley, October 1969), 9--10.] 

POS remained active in open space protections throughout the 1970s, 
pioneering the establishment of the Mid-Peninsula Open Space District in 
1972 as well as various conservation programs that protected the Suisan 
Marsh, agricultural preserves in Napa Valley, and the conservation 
of Angel Island State Park.

## Sprawl Brawl

San Jose's drive for growth began to slow in the early 1960s as 
homeowners in the suburban fringes of the city began opposing growth 
interests. In 1962, voters elected the first candidate to oppose growth 
in the city. Virginia Shaffer was a Republican from {DETAIL} who 
rose to office representing the interests of homeowners, including being 
the only city council member opposing consolidation with Alviso. But 
new interests were starting to guide ideas about the city's future. 

By 1970, the brakes were firmly pressed. Although San Jose's growth 
control measures never became quite as strident as those pursued in the 
northern peninsula cities of Menlo Park, Palo Alto, and Atherton, 
homeowners began demanding new policies to protect their natural views. 
Following the nation-wide trend in establishing land use controls to 
slow urban growth, only a single Bay Area town had growth control laws 
in 1972 but by 1975 thirty-one had established new regulations. 

San Jose followed the trend. One method of growth control came in the 
form of zoning for residential density. The City reduced residential 
density throughout the city from twelve to eighteen housing units per 
acre to six to eight units. New policies also required that no new 
development could be permitted until developers submitted environmental 
impact statements that specified how they would handle storm runoff, 
maintain open space, ensure the availability of city infrastructure, and 
accessible schools.^[Santa Clara County Planning Policy Committee, 
*Zoning and Housing* (San Jose: Santa Clara County Planning Department, 
1970); Santa Clara County Planning Policy Committee, "Urban 
Development/Open Space Plan for Santa Clara County, 1973-1978" (Santa 
Clara County Planning Department, n.d.), Box 4, Folder 96, League of 
Women Voters, San Jose/Santa Clara Chapter Records, San Jose State 
University Library Special Collections and Archives; Social Planning

Department, "Profile '70: A Socio-Economic Data Book for Santa Clara 
County"; San Jose City Planning Commission, Master Plan of the City of 
San Jose; San Jose City Planning Commission, *1981 Annual Review: The 
General Plan, List of Potential Land Use/Transportation Diagram and Text

Jose: City of San Jose, July 16, 1981), Box 4, Folder 94, League of 
Women Voters, San Jose/Santa Clara Chapter Records, San Jose State 
University Library Special Collections and Archives.]. In 1973, San Jose 
voters passed Measure B that prevented new residential development until 
adequate school space was provided for future residents.^[Kenneth T.  
Rosen and Lawrence F. Katz, "Growth Management and Land Use Controls: 
The San Francisco Bay Area Experience," *Real Estate Economics* 9, no. 4 
(December 1981): 332--333.] 

Many of these regulations, however, had the unintended affect of 
offloading the costs of development to consumers and made low- and 
mid-size developments unprofitable. In response, developers began 
building pricier housing that could only be purchased by high-income 
residents.^[Rosen and Katz, "Growth Management and Land Use Controls: 
The San Francisco Bay Area Experience," 328-331.] Various maneuvers to 
build low-income housing in Los Altos Hills, San Jose, and elsewhere in 
Silicon Valley were met by conservationists who complained that such 
projects threatened regulations preserving environmental land use 
regulations. Such conflicting concerns led Jack Ybarra, president of La 
Confederacion de la Raza Unida, to lash out at environmentalists. "If 
they're interested in preserving the foothills for a certain class of 
people," he argued, "then the conservationists are our enemies, 
too."^[*San Jose Mercury*, December 21, 1970. See also *Ybarra v. Town 
of Los Altos Hills*, 503 F.2d 250 (1974).] The landscape was a site of 
economic conflict.

Concerns about the environmental impact of growth moved to the forefront 
of the mayoral campaign between Janet Gray Hayes and Al Garza in 1974. 
The two platforms of the candidates revolved centrally around urban 
growth and environmental issues. Janet Hayes was voted into office in 
{YEAR}, the first woman to serve as mayor of a major metropolitan 
center. San Jose was quickly dubbed the "feminist capital of the world" 
as female politicians assumed positions of political power throughout 
San Jose government. Hayes was explicitly an environmentalist, 
identifying her own platform as {DETAIL}.

Voters shared these concerns. <!-- citing the Diridon study -->

Al Garza represented a different set of interests, speaking on behalf of 
developers and maintained his support of San Jose urban growth <!-- how 
does he define growth? What does that look like? What is "growth"? -->
