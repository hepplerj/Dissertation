<!--ARGUMENT: As "nature" receded underneath asphalt, Bay Area environmentalists 
sought to create places for "nature" through open space, etc.-->

Driving along the Bayshore Freeway from San Jose to Palo Alto, newcomers and 
old-timers alike would have a hard time distinguishing one town from another.  
Annexations and construction occurred as such a rapid pace that it obliterated 
the boundaries between towns. One could scarcely notice when passing over a 
city boundary, and the patchwork of annexations made this particularly 
problematic. <!-- I have a source somewhere that notes this problem. Is it the 
Hayes survey? Or something from California Tomorrow? -->

Environmental observers already determined that the sprawling cities were 
destroying the Bay Area. All across California, sprawl had become a defining 
feature of urban expansion. Such realities led Raymond Dasmann to blame postwar 
urban sprawl for the "destruction of California":

> Already we have filled the San Francisco Bay basin with housing, industry, 
> airfields, and highways, from the tops of the hills to the edge of the 
> water. The same thing has happened to Los Angeles. In the Central Valley, 
> from the head in the sloughs leading to San Francisco Bay as far east as the 
> Sierra foothills, one housing tract replaces another in a formless mass of 
> suburbs that have been aptly named ‘slurbs.’ If it could end at this it 
> would be bad enough, but reparable. Instead, the process goes on. Housing 
> and industry spread even farther, engulfing farm and forest, marsh and 
> pasture with no end in sight except the dismal one of a gigantic, 
> disorganized metropolis, filling much of the state and depending for its 
> food on distant lands.^[Dasmann, *The Destruction of California*, p. 19. 
> Quoted in Rome, *Bulldozer in the Countryside*, p. 139.]
