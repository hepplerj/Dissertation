<!--ARGUMENT: As "nature" receded underneath asphalt, Bay Area environmentalists
sought to create places for "nature" through open space, etc.-->

Journalist Leonard Downie could scarcely find nature in Silicon Valley.
Visiting San Jose in the early 1970s, he concluded that the only
remaining open space existed along the "carefully tended and regularly
watered greenery along the shoulders of the county's many freeways." The
Santa Clara Valley had become defined by the clusters of poorly-built
and quickly constructed homes, traffic that had given the air a
"mustard-colored haze," and urban space so compact that there existed no
"open spaces, parks or even sidewalks." Downie blamed poor planning and
greed for the valley's urban problems, citing a study that found
residential density could be maintained near 1973 levels in just thirty
square miles that could have saved miles of open space and orchards.
Santa Clara County, Downie concluded, had become a "jigsaw puzzle of intertwined
suburbs" and the land "systematically ravaged" by "speculators,
developers, other entrepreneurs and homebuyers."^[Leonard Downie, Jr.,
"A Misplanned Suburb," *Washington Post*, December 30, 1973.]

Downie was not alone in questioning the value of urban growth at the 
expense of disappearing open space. After a decade-long boom that saw 
Bay Area cities sprawl throughout the San Francisco Peninsula, activists 
began promoting the protection of open space open space for recreation, 
aesthetics, and health. All along the Peninsula, advocates argued for 
new restrictions on city growth and the protection of greenbelts, public 
parks, and wilderness areas. "Already we have filled the San Francisco 
basin with housing, industry, airfields, and highways, from the tops of 
the hills to the edge of the water," wrote Raymond Desmann. If the 
process proceeded, Dasmann feared a "gigantic, disorganized metropolis" 
"engulfing farm and forest, marsh and pasture with no end in 
sight."^[Dasmann, *The Destruction of California*, 19.] Debates over 
open space in Santa Clara Valley followed three branches.  The first 
emerged among expert urban planners and residential activists, who 
relied on professionals to form a critique of poor urban planning and 
the loss of natural landscapes.  The second came from anti-growth and 
no-growth advocates who urged tightened restrictions on the places that 
cities were allowed to expand.  Finally, another branch of activists 
focused their argument around issues of recreation. Together, these 
activists shared a common language---using terms such as "beauty," 
"wilderness," "ecology"---but used that vocabulary to defend and define 
different goals. The advocates for open space revealed a clash between 
competing political ideas and urban priorities, and the very definition 
of "nature" sat at the middle of the conflict.

The debate over the protection of open space played out across the 
United States.
