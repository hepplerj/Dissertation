<!--ARGUMENT: As "nature" receded underneath asphalt, Bay Area environmentalists
sought to create places for "nature" through open space, etc.-->

Journalist Leonard Downie could scarcely find nature in Silicon Valley.
Visiting San Jose in the early 1970s, he concluded that the only
remaining open space existed along the "carefully tended and regularly
watered greenery along the shoulders of the county's many freeways." The
Santa Clara Valley had become defined by the clusters of poorly-built
and quickly constructed homes, traffic that had given the air a
"mustard-colored haze," and urban space so compact that there existed no
"open spaces, parks or even sidewalks." Downie blamed poor planning and
greed for the valley's urban problems, citing a study that found
residential density could be maintained near 1973 levels in just thirty
square miles that could have saved miles of open space and orchards.
Santa Clara County, Downie concluded, had become a "jigsaw puzzle of intertwined
suburbs" and the land "systematically ravaged" by "speculators,
developers, other entrepreneurs and homebuyers."^[Leonard Downie, Jr.,
"A Misplanned Suburb," *Washington Post*, December 30, 1973.]

Downie was not alone in questioning the value of urban growth at the 
expense of disappearing open space. By the mid-1960s, advocates of 
protecting open space for recreation, aesthetics, and health came to 
dominate the environmental discourse in the Bay Area. All along the 
Peninsula, advocates argued for new restrictions on city growth and the 
protection of greenbelts, public parks, and wilderness areas. Debates 
over open space in Santa Clara Valley followed three branches.  The 
first emerged among expert urban planners and residential activists, who 
relied on professionals to form a critique of poor urban planning and 
the loss of natural landscapes. The second came from anti-growth and 
no-growth advocates who urged tightened restrictions on the places that 
cities were allowed to expand. Finally, another branch of activists 
focused their argument around issues of recreation. Together, these 
activists shared a common language---using terms such as "beauty," 
"wilderness," "ecology"---but used that vocabulary to defend and define 
different goals. The advocates for open space revealed a clash between 
competing political ideas and urban priorities, and the very definition 
of "nature" sat at the middle of the conflict.

If you aggregated the Bay Area's greenbelts, open space, reserves, and
parks, geographer Richard Walker has noted, the total amounts to more
protected land than the entirety of Yosemite National
Park. More than 3.75 million acres are protected open space and open
water, while only 750,000 acres lie beneath the built environment.^[@walker2007countrycity, 3.]

Environmental observers already determined that the sprawling cities were
destroying the Bay Area. All across California, sprawl had become a defining
feature of urban expansion. Such realities led Raymond Dasmann to blame postwar
urban sprawl for the "destruction of California":

> Already we have filled the San Francisco Bay basin with housing, industry,
> airfields, and highways, from the tops of the hills to the edge of the
> water. The same thing has happened to Los Angeles. In the Central Valley,
> from the head in the sloughs leading to San Francisco Bay as far east as the
> Sierra foothills, one housing tract replaces another in a formless mass of
> suburbs that have been aptly named 'slurbs.' If it could end at this it
> would be bad enough, but reparable. Instead, the process goes on. Housing
> and industry spread even farther, engulfing farm and forest, marsh and
> pasture with no end in sight except the dismal one of a gigantic,
> disorganized metropolis, filling much of the state and depending for its
> food on distant lands.^[Dasmann, *The Destruction of California*, 19.
> Quoted in Rome, *Bulldozer in the Countryside*, 139.]

\noindent Up and down the San Francisco Peninsula, environmentalists
would make the case for the protection of open space and begin
campaigning for strict limits on urban growth.

## Palo Alto Stops Industrialization


## Mountain View Welcomes Industry


## Recreation in the Foothills
