<!--ARGUMENT: As "nature" receded underneath asphalt, Bay Area environmentalists
sought to create places for "nature" through open space, etc.-->

Journalist Leonard Downie could scarcely find nature in Silicon Valley. Visiting
San Jose in the early 1970s, he concluded that the only remaining open space
existed along the "carefully tended and regularly watered greenery along the
shoulders of the county's many freeways."^[Leonard Downie, Jr., "A Misplanned
Suburb," *Washington Post*, December 30, 1973.]

Driving along the Bayshore Freeway from San Jose to Palo Alto, newcomers and
old-timers alike would have a hard time distinguishing one town from another.
Annexations and construction occurred as such a rapid pace that it obliterated
the boundaries between towns. One could scarcely notice when passing over a
city boundary, and the patchwork of annexations made this particularly
problematic. <!-- I have a source somewhere that notes this problem. Is it the
Hayes survey? Or something from California Tomorrow? -->

Environmental observers already determined that the sprawling cities were
destroying the Bay Area. All across California, sprawl had become a defining
feature of urban expansion. Such realities led Raymond Dasmann to blame postwar
urban sprawl for the "destruction of California":

> Already we have filled the San Francisco Bay basin with housing, industry,
> airfields, and highways, from the tops of the hills to the edge of the
> water. The same thing has happened to Los Angeles. In the Central Valley,
> from the head in the sloughs leading to San Francisco Bay as far east as the
> Sierra foothills, one housing tract replaces another in a formless mass of
> suburbs that have been aptly named 'slurbs.' If it could end at this it
> would be bad enough, but reparable. Instead, the process goes on. Housing
> and industry spread even farther, engulfing farm and forest, marsh and
> pasture with no end in sight except the dismal one of a gigantic,
> disorganized metropolis, filling much of the state and depending for its
> food on distant lands.^[Dasmann, *The Destruction of California*, 19.
> Quoted in Rome, *Bulldozer in the Countryside*, 139.]

Up and down the San Francisco Peninsula, environmentalists would make the case
for the protection of open space and begin campaigning for strict limits on
urban growth.

## San Jose's Sprawling End


## Palo Alto Stops Industrialization


## Mountain View Welcomes Industry
