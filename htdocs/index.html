<p id="pitch">Between 1945 and 1960s, computers served as sites of meaning surrounding debates about the New West.</p>

<p>Government officials, university administrators, student protesters, and urban leaders all developed ideas about the role electronics research would serve in shaping the economic, social, and political development of their region. This project simultaneously charts the history of computing machines and the growth of research universities and their influence upon American society during the Cold War, but specifically deals with how people envisioned the development of computer technology and its potential impact upon the region, nation, and world. How people thought about computers is the central story, located in the geographic region of the American West.</p>

<p>How people thought about the future of their region tells us much about prevailing attitudes and gives shape to social, cultural, and political contours of the Cold War. As Ted Friedman notes, debates and discussions over computers are significant because “they are where we talk about the future.”[1] The hopes, fears, and aspirations embedded in discussions about computers reflected shared and competing visions of the region’s future development. For Westerners, how they thought about, discussed, debated, and reacted to the invention of digital computing, federal funding for computer research, the growth of universities and companies, and the evolution of new technologies illustrates broader discussions about the New West and the region’s role in the postwar world.</p>
