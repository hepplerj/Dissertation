# 1954 promises to be active in M.P. building

<pb>Page: 7</pb>

Nineteen fifty-four promises to be a lively building year in Menlo Park, judging from the situation on New Year's Day.

Work is underway on a $67,000 dental-medical clinic and on a $52,000 market. A building permit for a $26,000 addition to another clinic will be issued next week, and construction of a $25,000 office building will probably start in the early spring. 

The biggest project is Dr. Harry Foley's $67,000 dental-medical building on Oak Grove Ave. opposite the new fire station. There will be suites for three doctors and three dentists, with a total floor space of 4630 square feet.

Dr. Foley, a Menlo Park dentist for 10 years, said he is attempting to set a standard for development of Oak Grove. The street, on the north edge of the central business district, is practically undeveloped at present.

Although zoning there would permit complete coverage of the lot, he has set the front of the building back 11 feet from the sidewalk to provide a planting area. Similarly, the rear line is set back three feet. The suites are divided by a 15-foot walkway between the doctors offices on one side and the dentists' on the other. This area will also be landscaped.

"I'm pioneering because that can be a beautiful street," Foley declared. "I hope others will be encouraged to follow suit."

The building will be one story, with a calstone exterior, but is being so constructed that a second floor can be added later. Aro & Okerman of Palo Alto are the contractors. Leslie I. Nichols is the architect. Dr. Foley said completion is scheduled for early June.

Work has also started on the Butera brothers' market on the old site of Bertrand's Oakwood Inn. Dan Atell, the owner, said the total cost will be around $52,000. Overall, dimensions are 97 by 67 1/2 feet. Parking for 50 cars will be provided on the sides and in front, he said.

J. C. Rowe is the builder. Barney C. Dahl designed it.

Building Inspector James D. Steiger said a $26,000 permit will be issued shortly for a big addition to the Sobrato medical building on Noel Drive. An entire new unit will be added.

Peter Kump, Menlo Park architect, has taken out a $100 building permit to raze a home at 664 Roble Ave. Kump said he plans to put a $25,000 professional office building there if he can obtain a variance from the planning commission.

The area is zoned for professional use, he said, but a lot of at least 10,000 square feet is required. His and other adjoining lots have about 8500 square feet, he said.

Plans he has prepared will provide quarters for himself and other professional tenant. There will be a paved parking area for 15 cars and a building of about 2000 square feet. Kump said he hopes to start construction this spring.
