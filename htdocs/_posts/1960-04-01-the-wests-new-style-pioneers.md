# The Wests New Style Pioneers

*Senator and Mrs. Stanford, in that remarkable document which is the Founding Grant, made many far-seeing statements &#8212; not the least prescient of which was their change to the institution that it "advance learning, the arts, and sciences, and to assist by experimentation and research in the dissemination and practical application of the same. The public at large, and not alone the comparatively few students who can attend the University, are the chief and ultimate beneficiaries..." Though its multidisciplinary approach Stanford Research Institute &#8212; a branch of the same institutional tree &#8212; pursues that 75-year-old ideal.*

The years since World War II have brought momentous change to the West, to the State of California, and to Stanford. Burgeoning population, rapid expansion of industry, and a revolution in transportation have transformed the Pacific Slope from an area of relative isolation into a region of vast economic, technical, social, and political significance.

A new kind of pioneering is vital to this upsurge. But these new pioneers are more at home with test tubes and computers than with shovels and axes. Their job is to develop new knowledge, and apply it systematically so that the society of which they are a part will build rather than merely grow. In 13 short years Stanford Research Institute has become a key agency in this development &#8212; so much so that its influence is now felt all over the world.

The Stanford campus and its surroundings &#8212; as a representative slice of the West &#8212; provide insight into the forces shaping the

![The Wests New Style Pioneers](path/to/jpg.jpg "The Wests New Style Pioneers")

future of the region. Before 1940 the University was still very much the "Farm" that the Stanfords themselves knew. Flanking the Quad were the open fields and orchards of the Santa Clara Valley, and the homes of Palo Alto &#8212; a college town of about 16,000 residents. Over the years the student body of the institution had gradually attained a size of about 4,000.

In the space of two decades the University and the mid-Peninsula have changed tremendously. In the place of open fields are an industrial park, a shopping center, and a new medical complex. Orchards have given way to subdivisions. Palo Alto serves as the hub of a thriving electronics industry. Its population has more than tripled. Stanford has grown apace, with a current enrollment of nearly 8,500; it has new dormitories, new lecture halls, and new laboratories. 

The regional upsurge behind such changes has made new and fundamental demands on Stanford &#8212; demands to which it has responded well. Perhaps some of Stanford's recent growth was predictable, but the power, speed, and direction of this expansion have been influenced by great leadership and by the ability of the University to be an active social force as well as an educational institution. 

### A Key Role in Western Development

Since its founding Stanford has participated in the development of the West through the contributions of its faculty and graduates, many of whom have played key roles in the life of the region. But in the wake of World War II the Trustees realized that the Pacific Slope was on the threshold of a tremendous expansion &#8212; an expansion that threatened to swallow up land, water, energy, and community facilities at an unparalleled pace. New resources, new markets, and new demands were creating a need for technical, economic, and scientific manpower. 

To meet this need, Stanford moved to expand its educational and research facilities. Additionally the Trustees, with the support of Western business leaders, began the development of a new source of manpower &#8212; Stanford Research Institute.

The founding of SRI might seem a departure from the University's fundamentally academic posture. But there was ample provision for this new undertaking, and from a basic source: the Founding Grant of the University, written nearly 75 years ago.

The Grant is a striking document which sets forth a unique status for the University. In addition to "qualifying students for personal success and direct usefulness in life," the Grant also charges the University "...to advance learning, the arts, and sciences, and to assist by experimentation and research in the dissemination and practical application of the same. The public at large, and not alone the comparatively few students who can attend the University, are the chief and ultimate beneficiaries of the foundation."

### Like a Wholly-Owned Subsidiary

SRI, then, was initiated in 1946 in execution of part of the Founding Grant. The fledgling Institute was organized as an independent, non-profit corporation which, among other things, would "promote the educational purposes of Stanford University by encouraging, fostering, and conducting scientific investigations and pure and applied research."

![The Wests New Style Pioneers](path/to/jpg.jpg "The Wests New Style Pioneers")

Ultimate control of the Institute was vested in the University Board of Trustees, who as General Members of the SRI Corporation elect the Institute Board of Directors. The University President is *ex officio* chairman of the SRI Board of Directors.

The term "affiliated" is most often used to describe the relationship between the University and the Institute. The two institutions have also been described as "first cousins," or as separate branches on the same family tree. In business terms, if the University could be considered as an ordinary corporation, then the Institute would be a wholly-owned subsidiary &#8212; operating separately.

Officially, SRI began in December 1946, but probably very few campus residents of those days were aware of the Institute's two-room office in the Physics Corner of the Quad. In the spring of 1947 SRI moved to Stanford Village in Menlo Park to occupy temporary buildings of the old Dibble General Hospital, which the University was leasing from the federal government to handle an expanded post-war housing need. In 1953 Stanford bought the 85-acre Village with the proviso that it eventually would be sold to SRI when the University was able to close out its Village operation.

### More Than 3,000 Research Assignments

In purely physical terms the expansion of the Institute has been extremely rapid. The three-man staff has grown to nearly 1,800 permanent employees, more than half of whom have professional training. In 13 years SRI has carried out more than 3,000 research assignments worth about $100 million. Last year the total volume of research exceeded $22 million.

Former Village residents will be particularly aware of the Institute's growth. A new 110,000-square-foot administration building now takes up 500 feet of frontage on Ravenswood Avenue, and a second unit is under construction. The student apartments that once encircled the Institute are now surrounded by Institute offices and laboratories. The diapers and tricycles that have long been part of the Village scene are giving way to beakers and computers. SRI now owns 52 acres of Village land and will purchase the balance by 1965.

There have been changes for SRI outside of Menlo Park as well. Stanford alumni in other parts of the U.S. may be aware of SRI laboratories in South Pasadena and of its offices and representatives in Portland, Phoenix, Washington, D.C., New York, and Honolulu. Overseas travelers may have run across the SRI office in Zurich or encountered one of the Institute research teams that operated in 18 countries last year.

### Special Circumstances Aided Institute

The reasons for the Institute's growth are to be found in a combination of unique and fortuitous circumstances. 

First, the Institute had the advantage of heredity. The leadership provided high goals and a challenge to excellence for the fledgling institution. Not only the Institute, but the entire mid-peninsula area can attribute a great portion of their development to the presence and influence of the University.

Second, SRI was blessed by the usual vision of the Founding Grant. This document and the Institute charter, with a generous concern for the welfare of mankind and a lack of restriction on geography and subject matter, gave SRI the freedom to develop a broad range of interests and abilities. 

Third, the timing was right. Both the research community and the regional economy were entering a period of dramatic expansion. For example, in 1940 total research and development expenditures in the U.S. were about $750 million. In 1960, R & D expenditures will probably exceed $12 billion. Thus, SRI was established at a time peculiarly favorable to the development of a research organization.

Fourth, there was the advantage of geography. The availability of the temporary buildings enabled the Institute to concentrate on staff development and research content, rather than on bricks and mortar. Location in an ideal climate has also been an attractive for top-flight scientific talent.

Fifth and most important have been the motivations and challenges which have impelled the staff to research achievement. No organization, no matter how noble its purpose or how splendid its equipment, can truly succeed without the spirit of accomplishment engendered by an energetic and enthusiastic staff.

### Research Clients Cover Wide Range

The principal activity of the Institute is contract research for clients, who include government, industry, foundations, and individuals. As might be expected, many contracts originate through outside inquiries with the prospective client posing specific problems to the Institute staff. However, the reverse is also true. The Institute may initiate new research programs and then seek client support. Such programs usually develop out of the individual interest of a staff member, or out of an Institute awareness of public need in certain research areas.

Whether initiated by the Institute or by a client, the contract procedure is the same. Once the problem is established, 

![The Wests New Style Pioneers](path/to/jpg.jpg "The Wests New Style Pioneers")

SRI prepares a research proposal which states the approach, the time element, the reporting arrangements, and the cost. Charges are based on the actual cost of the research plus a development factor to cover maintenance and improvement of SRI research facilities. The estimated cost is not to be exceeded without client approval, and any amount unspent is returned when the project is terminated.

In choosing research assignments the Institute finds special attractiveness in programs which require combinations of talent in basic and applied sciences &#8212; problems too diversified for a single discipline. The ability to provide a variety of talents and build them into a team to tackle the "whole" problem is characteristic of the research institute as an organization. Primary emphasis is on programs where the Institute can utilize the diverse talents of its staff in unique combinations, where it can advance the "state of the art," where it can make the result available to the public at large. 

### 'Techno-economic' Approach to Problems

Utilizing a "multi-disciplinary" approach, SRI has achieved research results that would be impossible under a narrow, single-discipline system. The Institute was a pioneer in the "techno-economic" approach to problem-solving, and this approach has brought about new strengths, new approaches, and new solutions.

The operation of SRI appears deceptively simple. It may sound easy to assemble a pool of researchers &#8212; physicists, chemists, economists, engineers, biologists &#8212; and to construct teams of these specialists to fit any research need that comes along, but such is not the case. No research organization, no matter how large or well-endowed it is (and SRI has no endowment at all), can afford to undertake every attractive research project that comes to its attention if it hopes to achieve more than a series of minor technical advances. Research activity is destined small efforts, or if devolved to fields which are unrelated to the organization's long-range plan.

Therefore, while the Institute prides itself on its diversity, it does not attempt to be all things to all men. The real problem, then, is one of selectivity and of fitting research projects into broad programs that make possible interdisciplinary approaches to well-defined, long-range goals.

In every discussion of a research organization, the question arises as to what it has achieved. Science, it seems, is most easily understood in terms of practical applications or "breakthroughs." Indeed, many of SRI's achievements might be so described if viewed as single "one-shot" assignments. But because of the broad program approach at the Institute, these so-called "breakthroughs" become simply halting steps toward larger, more important goals. 

### The First Known Sputnik I Contact

To illustrate, in 1957 the Institute, using its radar telescope, made the first known radar contact with Sputnik I. SRI's interest, however, was not merely in the satellite itself, but more in the fact that it provided a new reflective program of upper atmosphere research. This same program encompasses such diverse topics as long-range weather prediction, air pollution, space navigation, and radio communication.

Another project resulted in a special purpose computer that mechanized the banking industry. Yet this was just a way-point in an information handling program that includes investigations in electronic printing, paper handling, inking systems, instrumentation, and automatic reading.

Similarly, the development of a new heat-resistant alloy is merely one small piece of a high temperature program

![The Wests New Style Pioneers](path/to/jpg.jpg "The Wests New Style Pioneers")

that includes considerations of solar energy, ceramics, chemical processes, semi-conductors, and combustion.

The nature of a research organization requires that it maintain a state of constant change and a readiness to phase out old programs and initiate new ones. At the same time the Institute has to balance the relative importance of research that is clearly directed towards its goals, but for which it may be difficult to get support, against research that is almost demanded by the needs of the nation, but not so clearly directed to the aims of the Institute. 

There is no easy solution to this problem. In all cases the ideal is for programs that are creative, unique, significant, and high in research content. They usually complement other programs in progress or planned either at the Institute or the University. In cases where support is lacking, SRI has limited funds to finance research of its own. Such undertakings are usually confined to public service research or inquiries of a basic nature.

### Increasing Emphasis on Basic Research

In the past, SRI has been thought of as primarily an applied research organization. The future promises increasing emphasis on developing new basic knowledge, without which there can be no applied research progress. In fact, the research community in general is agreed on the need for increasing basic research. Today the lead time between fundamental studies and applied research is decreasing; consequently man requires basic knowledge faster than he generates it. In the universities, the traditional home of basic science, concern is often expressed that increased teaching loads and economic pressures may inhibit productivity in fundamental areas. At the same time, however, private research institutes such as SRI have reached a state of maturity and development where they are ready to take part in the expansion of basic research.

The problems of our times and the widening capabilities of the scientific method emphasize two other great needs. One is for more effective integration of research efforts among scientific disciplines. The second is for even greater attention to the social sciences.

This is an age of specialization. Yet the urgency of the world's problems can only be met by avoiding the overspecialization that narrows the path of inquiry. The solutions lie in greater recognition of the inter-dependence of all human endeavor.

The need for greater understanding among people and nations is surely paramount today. The problems are many &#8212; crime, race relations, education, labor-management relations, mental health, human motivations, and international tensions. More research in social sciences is a great need today. SRI hopes that the present imbalance between research on "things" and research on human problems will be corrected. 

### Research Helps Set U.S. Foreign Policy

In this connection the Institute has not been inactive. For example, last year SRI undertook a study for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to assess fields of scientific and technological development which might affect the foreign policy decisions of the U.S. government. More recently SRI played a major role in a conference on our balance of payments problem and its effect on foreign policy. Through these and similar programs runs the thread of concern for the public welfare which is the cornerstone of Institute activities.

As the Institute embarks on its 14th year it stands as one of the largest organizations of its kind in the world. While growth has been important, physical size is not a goal in itself. The yardstick is qualitative rather than quantitative. With its growing stature and maturity, SRI looks for a continual upgrading of its staff, its programs, and its contributions.

The principal aim of SRI management is to maintain a framework in which the creative talents of the staff can realize the purposes of the SRI Charter, and to create an atmosphere in which the spirit of inquiry can thrive.

### Men of Ideas Set Research Directions

In a large measure the research directions of SRI are not set by the directors, the president, or the management committee. The research directions are set by the staff members who write and issue proposals for research. These are the men with the ideas for new research areas, and the ability and courage to push back the unknown.

It is by providing guidance, inspiration, and principles to the SRI staff that SRI management can make its most effective contribution. It is in these same basic areas that the Institute gratefully acknowledges the countless contributions of the University whose name it bears.
