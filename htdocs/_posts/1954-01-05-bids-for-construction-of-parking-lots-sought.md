# Bids for construction of parking lots sought

<pb>Page: 1</pb>

By spring, there will be parking spaces for an additional 150 cars in Palo Alto's University Ave. business district.

This increase in the parking capacity will be provided by three off-street parking lots which the city is getting ready to develop.

The lots are on Gilman St., Hamilton Ave. across from the post office, and on the Ramona St. site of the old city hall. 

The Gilman property, 100x112.5 feet, is figured to accomodate 36 cars; the Hamilton site, 82x195 feet, 42 cars; and the old city hall location (including a slice from the adjacent park), an irregular 98x177 feet, 72 cars.

Next Monday evening the city council will be asked to authorize the calling for bids on the improvement of the Gilman and Hamilton lots, which are included in the proposed assessment district.

The old city hall site is not to be in the assessment district, but it is expected that the bid awarded will be for the three lots.

In authorizing the city manager to proceed with the demolition of the old city hall--a task that has just been completed--as well as the construction of the parking lot, the city council last Nov. 9 directed that a study be made of the recommendation that a public rest room be provided on the site.

Old buildings have been removed from the properties on Gilman and Hamilton, and the telephone company is scheduled to raze a structure that intrudes a little onto the city's site on Hamilton.

The bids to be asked will be for concrete and paving work on the lots and the setting of electroliers and parking meter posts, which the city itself will purchase. Landscaping areas also will be developed by the city.
