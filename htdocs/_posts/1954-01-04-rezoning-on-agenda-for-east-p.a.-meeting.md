# Rezoning on agenda for East P.A. meeting

<pb>Page: 20</pb>

All phases of rezoning planning in East Palo Alto will be on the agenda when the zoning committee for an East Palo Alto master plan meets tonight at 8 in the Ravenswood School cafeteria on Euclid Ave.

According to chairman Ernest Stelter, recommendations of his committee for a modified commercial area and suggestion for changes or increases in residential and industrial areas will be presented for consideration of East Palo Altans.

At the last meeting of the group in December suggestions were made that the proposed commercial area near University Ave and Bayshore be moved to an O'Connor St-Cooley Ave position. After the meeting, according to Stelter, there were objections to this proposal, especially from residents on University Ave. His committee has considered both sides and will make a recommendation tonight, he announces. 

"We wish to cover all phases of zoning so that our recommendation can be made to the San Mateo County planning commission in the near future to use as a basis for its proposed master plan for East Palo Alto," Stelter concluded.
