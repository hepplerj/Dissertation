# 400 Routed at Stanford

<pb>Page: </pb>

Policement firing tear gas routed 400 antiwar demonstrators today from the street in front of an annex of the Stanford Research Institute, four blocks from the Stanford University campus.

The police action came after the demonstrators had held control of the streets in the Stanford Industrial Park for four hours, bottling up traffic and succeeding in their goal of shutting down operations at the annex.

At one point the demonstrators created a massive traffic jam along a major Palo Alto road by barricading intersections, letting air out of tires, and stalling their own cars.

The demonstrators, mostly Stanford University students, were protesting a decision of the Stanford board of trustees to sever university ties with the institute, and trying to stop counter-insurgency research conducted at the annex.

The police arrested 16 demonstrators, including one juvenile, on charges of trespassing and failure to disperse.
