<p>It looks as though the year 1954 is going to be another busy one for the City of Palo Alto.</p>

<p>Continuing a trend that has been developing since the close of World War II, the city last year experienced marked growth during 1953.</p>

<p>In the words of City Manager Jerry Keithley, “1953 was a year of progress, growth and achievement. Our city has more than doubled in population during the past 13 years, and it is obvious that the future will see continued growth. The pattern of growth is evidenced by the $10 million valuation of construction permits issued last year and also by the increase in land area from 8.657 square miles to 9.159 miles.</p>

<p>To the best of our ability, the growth has been planned, and all departments of the city government are geared for handling this growth.”</p>

<p>The manager told the Times that the staff did a great deal last year to modernize the administrative and operational procedures of the various departments of the municipal government.</p>

<p>At the mid point of the fiscal year, the city’s financial condition is good, according to Controller Maurice Moore. Municipal operations, he said, are well within the budget as approved last July. The general fund budget for the year is $1,801,504.45, which does not include funds unaffected by the tax levy. In this category are the publicly owned utility plants.</p>

<p>Palo Alto starts the new year with an estimated population of 35,252 residents. The special census taken last February showed an actual count of 33,753, an increase of <unclear title="Unclear">8,563</unclear> since the 1950 census.</p>

<p>What lies ahead this year?</p>

<p>The program is extensive. Here are some of the more important topics which the municipal government will consider during the next 12 months:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Acquisition of off-street parking lots in the central business district, and their improvement. The project is well advanced, and the official negotiator is at present conferring with property owners to determine their attitude toward selling desired holdings.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formulation of a decision on the proposed expansion of the Palo Alto Hospital. The subject is still under study. A large financial outlay, probably involving a bonding proposition, is indicated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completion of a general, or master, plan for the city. The planning department has prepared a detailed outline of the studies and analysis necessary for the preparation of the master plan, of which the land use survey is a part. One-third of a detailed land use survey designed to provide the city with information concerning the use of each individual piece of property has already been completed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Attempting to obtain a reduction in fire insurance rates applicable to the entire city. To this end an effort will be made to get a Class 3 classification instead of the present Class 4. The Board of Fire Underwriters of the Pacific will be asked to make a survey to ascertain what must be done to improve the rating. If a Class 3 rating is achieved, substantial insurance savings will accrue to citizens.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evolving a six-year capital budgeting program for the city government, as a means of guiding the council and the administration in arranging for the financing of important improvements from year to year. In this long-range program such matters might be included as expansion of the sewage disposal plant, purchasing a fire ladder, trees, adding an electric substation, or constructing a new public library.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Working for the improvement of the Palo Alto Yacht Harbor. The county is expected to contribute heavily toward that project, since the <unclear title="Unclear"> aquatic [unclear] </unclear> <pb>Page: 5</pb> as a recreational feature to benefit county as well as city residents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Erection of modern street lights in “District 2” as decided upon last month, and projecting similar facilities for the remainder of the older city not having the latest luminaires. College Terrace and areas west of Alma St. are the principal districts yet to be provided with these facilities.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Erecting new type street name signs in scattered parts of the city. There are about 100 signs remaining to be installed, at a cost estimated at $2000. In 1953 the city erected 282 sets of the new signs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Initiation of a visiting nursing service. The program has the approval of the city council, which will put up $5000 to cover the cost of the nurse. The money will be returned by residents using the service, on the basis of $4.50 for a brief visit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improvement of the runway at the Palo Alto Airport. The San Mateo County Board of Supervisors has indicated an interest in the project, and financial support is possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Construction of a municipal golf course on city-owned bay lands. This project, assured by public contributions to the development fund raised last year, is expected to get under way in the spring.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Modernizing the exterior of the old power plant on Newell Rd., opposite the new city hall, to give it a more attractive appearance. Screen planting around the near-by electric substation is also planned.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Bringing to completion three substations in the 60 kv. electric loop encircling the city. This project, launched last year, will ensure the city adequate electric service for many years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Development of plans for the 18-acre public park and playground on East Meadow Drive adjacent to the new Ray Lyman Wilbur Junior High School.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Renovating the Community Center by replacing wiring, roofing, and the heating system. Resurfacing tennis courts at the Center is likewise contemplated.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Evolving a plan for a grade separation in South Palo Alto, possibly at Oregon Ave. The city manager is now analyzing the problem of site and other relevant data.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Among the achievements for 1953, as noted by Keithley, are the following:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Construction of the new city hall.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Resurfacing 13 miles of city streets.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Erection of three parking and recreation buildings at Rinconda, Peers, and El Camino parks.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Acquisition of four new water wells.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase of one new 1000-gallon per minute fire truck.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The winning of a national award for outstanding traffic law enforcement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prevention of a proposal to increase the wholesale gas rate charged the city utility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Inauguration of a joint financial program with the school district to construct a year-round swimming pool in South Palo Alto area.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Formulation of a Halloween community program to minimize juvenile destructiveness.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completion of a 2 million gallon sewer trunk line to the newly annexed Stanford properties.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The planting of 2000 ornamental street trees.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Construction of Charleston Rd. between Alma St. and Middlefield Rd.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Purchase of two off-street parking lots to accomodate 81 cars, together with demolition of the old city hall to make space for an additional 72 cars.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Installation of utility collection depositories in the two main business districts, along with modernization of the utility collection program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Completing the street improvement project, known as 52-10, North California Ave., et al.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Erection of four sets of automatic traffic signals.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Provision for a full-time city attorney.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Annexation of 24 acres of land in the San Antonio Rd. area and of 297.5 acres of Stanford lands, on which extensive improvements of a commercial nature are expected to be developed this year.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Establishment of a municipal court, under county auspices.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Tieing in the city water system with the San Francisco supply at a point on Arastradero Rd. This substantially increases the city’s capacity to take care of the needs of the growing population.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Opening the drive-in service for utility consumers wishing to pay bills at the new city hall. This service is reported to be increasingly popular.</p>
  </li>
