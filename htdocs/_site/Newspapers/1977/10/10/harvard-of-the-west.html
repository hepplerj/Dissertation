<h1 id="harvard-of-the-west-climbing-in-ratings">‘Harvard of the West’ Climbing in Ratings</h1>

<p>Freshman students at Stanford University tell of a professor here who opened the term last week with the greeting: “Welcome to everyone who decided not to go to the Stanford of the East.”</p>

<p>As the professor’s sarcasm indicates, this institution, sometimes called the “Harvard of the West,” would like to reorient the nation’s thinking. Since World War II, Stanford has enjoyed remarkable success in transforming itself from a good regional institution into one of the country’s great private universities.</p>

<p>It is a development that has perhaps not been fully appreciated in the East where quality tends to be measured against the yardstick of the more familiar Ivy League colleges, but the signs of Stanford’s achievement are increasingly difficult to overlook.</p>

<p>The latest sign is the completion this year of Stanford’s $300 million, five-year fund raising campaign, one of the largest brought to a successful conclusion by any university. Coinciding with the drive were the ratings of several major polls that ranked Stanford’s graduate schools of business and education as first in the country. At the same time, the law school rose to third, behind Harvard and Yale, and the medical school has gained wide regard as being among the best.</p>

<h3 id="palm-tree-ambiance">Palm-Tree Ambiance</h3>

<p>The lone private university in its part of the country to gain such prestige, Stanford seems to many to epitomize what the Ivy League would look like with palm trees. Its sun-drenched, country club of a campus, aswarm with thousands of sandaled students on expensive bicycles, has the flavor of Spanish California with its low Mediterranean-style buildings with red-tiled roofs.</p>

<p>The casual atmosphere sometimes makes it difficult for Easterners to recognize the underlying seriousness of a distinguished faculty and a carefully selected student body. More than 10,000 applicants vie annually for 1,500 freshman undergraduate slots, enabling the university to choose a class that averages 690 in mathematics and 610 in verbal skills out of 800 maximum on the Scholastic Aptitude Test.</p>

<p>Of the high school seniors who turn down a Stanford acceptance, about a third enroll at Harvard, Yale, Princeton or Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>About one-half of the 6,435 undergraduates are from California and some observers wonder if they have the same intensity about them as students at the East’s most prestigious institutions.</p>

<p>“I came here braced for culture shock, but I found it delightful,” said Peter D. L. Stansky, a former New Yorker who joined the Stanford faculty in 1968 after studying and teaching at Harvard. “The students here are more mature and less sophisticated. They are less on guard and will admit whether or not they know something.”</p>

<h3 id="prestigious-faculty">Prestigious Faculty</h3>

<p>Mr. Stansky is now chairman of Stanford’s history department and head of the Faculty Senate, a body that reflects the distinction of a faculty that includes eight Nobel laureates and three Pulitzer Prize winners. Stanford’s faculty also has the second-largest number of National Medal of Science recipients and the fourth-largest number of National Academy of Science members.</p>

<p>An illustration of how Stanford has strengthened its reputation by building up its faculty is seen in the metamorphosis of the Graduate School of Business, which now draws almost 20 percent of its students from among the graduates of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Dartmouth and Smith.</p>

<p>In the office of Arjay Miller, the dean of the business school, there is an air of brisk efficiency, evoking a feeling that one might find in the executive suite of the Ford Motor Company, where Mr. Miller served as president before joining Stanford in 1968.</p>

<h3 id="fears-of-over-pricing">Fears of Over-Pricing</h3>

<p>The business school’s rise to pre-eminence is portrayed in pictures on Mr. Miller’s office wall of the professors occupying the 12 endowed chairs that he was largely responsible for adding to the school by raising $7.2 million.</p>

<p>Money is a subject on the minds of most administrators at Stanford, a university that carefully charted its way through the fiscal turbulencies of the 1970s by absorbing deficits with an $8 million reserve that it began building into its budgets in the 1950’s.</p>

<p>Stanford officials are sensitive to the fact that the institution’s annual tuition of $4,695—room and board are additional—is one of the nation’s steepest. They stress that 46 percent of the undergraduates are being helped with financial aid, but they know that further rises in tuition will make it increasingly difficult to avoid the image that of being a school for the children of the rich.</p>

<p>Richard W. Lyman, the president of Stanford since 1970, attributes much of the credit for the university’s improvement to the planning of his retired predecessors, Wallace Sterling and Frederick E. Terman, who as president and provost, according to Mr. Lyman, “saw the opportunities and seized them.”</p>

<p>One of their projects was to encourage the development of the so-called “Silicon Valley” in surrounding Santa Clara County, extending southward from the university. Hundreds of companies in the electronics and high technology industries have located there, creating a symbiotic relationship with the university that has contributed greatly to its teaching, research and fund raising.</p>

<p>So closely is Stanford linked to these companies that it has set aside 700 of its 8,100 acres for an industrial park in which the university leases space to 75 firms with 19,000 employees. </p>

<h3 id="many-construction-projects">Many Construction Projects</h3>

<p>The university is presently carrying out $45 million in construction at a time when some institutions are worrying about surplus space. A $78 million positron electron facility is also being built at the university’s Linear Accelerator Center, adjacent to the main campus. It is federally funded and cosponsored by the University of California’s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory. </p>

<p>The current expansion of the Stanford library will more easily house its 4.2-million volume collection. Mr. Lyman says of the expansion, “As long as the library was inadequate, it not only symbolized our gap in the humanities and social sciences, but also contributed to it.”</p>

<p>Stanford’s brilliance in engineering and science has tended to nudge the humanities and social sciences toward the shadows. It is a situation that some observers think has been exacerbated by a faculty that perhaps lacks the departmental breadth and depth found in some of the larger research universities. “We have to cover wider fields and there is no second-string,” said William A. Clembsch, chairman of Stanford’s seven-member religious studies department.</p>

<p>Some Stanford students are also troubled by what they perceive to be an inadequate emphasis on good teaching at a university that expects its faculty to win renown through research and publication.</p>

<p>“Some of our most popular teachers have been denied tenure,” said Larry Diamond, a doctoral candidate in sociology who is a former president of the undergraduate student government.</p>

<p>Mr. Diamond was chairman of a task force on tenure and teaching quality that was set up last year after students became incensed because the university turned down for tenure two candidates who had received campus awards for distinguished teaching. In May the Faculty Senate accepted the task force’s recommendation that the teaching in every Stanford course be evaluated regularly. A committee is now working to implement the proposal.</p>

<p>Student activism at Stanford is not restricted to the classroom. Student groups are trying to convince the trustees to sell $90 million of stock in companies with investments in South Africa. The cases of many of the 294 men and women arrested last May in a campus protest against Stanford’s investment policies are still pending in the Palo Alto Municipal Court.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the dispute that has been raging for five years. Stanford dropped its nickname, the Indians, in 1972 because native Americans found it offensive, but so far the university’s athletic teams are without an official replacement. The university has resisted adopting the nickname the students chose in a referendum. The students apparently had the university’s 19th century benefactor, Leland Stanford, one of the country’s biggest railroad magnates, in mind when they voted to call the teams the Robber Barons.</p>
