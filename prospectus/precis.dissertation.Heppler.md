*After meeting with my committee before I left for Stanford and having a chance to dig more deeply into source material, I've reframed aspects of the dissertation project that I am outlining below. The committee pushed me to think more about what sort of story I was trying to tell (urban? cultural? science and technology?) and urged me to do a broad survey into newspapers and other sources to get a clearer idea of the sort of issues people in Santa Clara Valley were discussing.*

*The story I wanted to tell from the outset was an urban history, and the committee left me asking the question: "What attends technology"? One answer that I came across in source material was: environmental change. Specifically, the issue of water became a key point in discussions about urban change and industrial growth in Santa Clara Valley. The legacy of these environmental issues remains with the Valley today, but the story has seldom been explored by historians or journalists. What follows is a slight of the dissertation, including what I feel is much greater clarity as to my topic, a much better handle on the available source material, and a tighter argument that will keep the dissertation from becoming too multi-varied or lengthy -- all concerns that had arisen during the prospectus defense. Below outlines a revised project narrative, potential chapters, and an annotated list of archival sources relating to those topics.*

# Abstract

This dissertation examines the environmental, economic, and cultural conflicts over high tech industrial development in California's Santa Clara Valley between 1950 and 1990. High technology manufacturing emerged as a dominant industrial activity in the second half of the twentieth century, particularly in California. As part of a larger wave of postindustrial manufacturing throughout the United States, postindustrial capitalism challenged the federal management of western water resources as urban and industrial demand for water increased following World War II. Growing affluence and educational levels in postwar America drew thousands of new residents to the Bay Area; coupled with industrial demands for water, California political leaders and federal officials sought ways to provide the state its water needs. But the development of new water policies and water projects proved problematic in the face of competing views over water use and management. The same natural allure that drew people to Santa Clara Valley also gave rise to a modern environmental movement that called for the preservation of wilderness, limits on urban and suburban growth, and reduction of pollution. These two views on nature -- one for the good of industrial and urban growth, the other for nature's sustainability -- came into increasing conflict particularly around industrial development. By the 1970s, critics denounced the environmental impact upon western water resources. Over four decades, political battles over the environmental, social, and economic impacts of industrial development raged through California. Water had become so key in political battles that state voters rejected the construction of aqueduct projects, supported new laws restricting urban and industrial growth, and community members formed a local environmental movement -- the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC) -- to provide a public and legal voice for the Valley's citizens. The story of Silicon Valley and water is not just a story of California, but Americans' changing understanding of the environmental costs of urban and industrial development and an awareness of the scarcity of a natural resource.

"Watering the Valley" examines the role of the federal government in fostering the development of high technology and the emergence of the new postindustrial West, where lands became more valuable as industry than cropland, causing a transformation from once rural valley into sprawling urban community reliant on the high technology industry.

Looking back on the four decades since William Hewlett and Richard Packard founded their high technology company in a Palo Alto garage, the *San Jose Mercury*, the city's oldest newspaper, surveyed ten causes of Silicon Valley's success. One of those causes was environmental: water. Beginning in 1965, water from the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta flowed forty-four miles through the South Bay Aqueduct, supplying the area with ten million-acre feet of water annually. Sig Sanchez, the director of the Santa Clara Valley Water District in the 1990s, recalled the project's importance to Silicon Valley. "It was our first import project, and it was essential to the growth we were anticipating," he remarked. "The valley would have grown, but not at the rate it has, because we would not have been able to accommodate the Silicon Valley."^["Water made orchards, silicon chip industry sprout faster," *San Jose Mercury*, December 22, 1999.] Water and economic growth went hand in hand.

Three large water projects would eventually bring a consistent source of fresh water into Santa Clara Valley. Twenty years after the South Bay Aqueduct, the San Felipe water system would be constructed through Pacheco Pass to move water out of the San Joaquin Valley. Additionally, the Santa Clara Valley consumed water from the Hetch Hetchy system, which today supplies about half the water used throughout the Bay Area.^[As of 1996, 42 percent of the Valley's water comes from local reservoirs, 23 percent from the federal Central Valley Project (delivery of water started in 1987), 19 percent from the State Water Project (deliver started in 1965), and 16 percent purchased from the Hetch Hetchy aqueduct. @matthews2003dreams, p. 104.] Additional water conservation projects, including dams, reservoirs, percolation ponds, canals, and runoff capture, together helped provide the Valley with its water demands. James Lenihan, who served on the water conservation board in the 1960s and later served on the board for the Santa Clara Valley Water District, credited water project success on the absence of an environmental movement. "With the environmental movement, we would never have been able to do now what we did then," he said. "We were able to get it in place before the movement came along to say no more reservoirs, no pipelines, no aqueducts."^["Water made orchards, silicon chip industry sprout faster," *San Jose Mercury*, December 22, 1999.]

![Silicon Valley. The Santa Clara Valley lies between the Santa Cruz Mountains on the west and the Diablo Range to the east, largely encompassing the municipalities of San Jose, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, Menlo Park, and Redwood City. Between 1945 and 2000, San Jose became the largest city in the Bay Area and ranked the near the top of population growth in the nation.](figures/sv.png)

Unrestricted urban growth and economic development characterized much of Santa Clara Valley in the latter half of the twentieth century, but little told is the story of the environmental consequences of Silicon Valley and those who attempted to shape the conversation about the region's ecological future.[On the rise of the modern environmental movement, see @hays1987beauty, pp. 13--39; @rothman2000saving, pp. 131--159; @steinberg2002earth, pp. 239--261; @opie1998nature, pp. 404--433.] California voters became increasingly aware of the environmental considerations urban growth and industrial development had for their region, leading by the mid-1970s to voters rejecting new large-scale water projects. Furthermore, environmental groups such as the Friends of the Earth, the Sierra Club, and the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition began criticizing high technology firms and city leaders for their ignorance of ecological negligence. The costs of this negligence became most obvious in the 1980s, when cancer clusters and birth defects emerged among residents in San Jose. Investigators traced the source of the illnesses back to Fairchild Camera and Instrument Company, whose solvents waste storage tanks had leaked 60,000 gallons into groundwater supplies.^[Local and federal studies discovered that trichloroethane, a common industrial solvent used in the cleaning of semiconductor parts, was leaking out of storage takes and into groundwater. The problem was not limited to Fairchild; other high technology plants had similar issues. Health effects of consuming the contaminated water ranged from liver and kidney damage to skin rashes. "U.S. to Study Pollution in High-Technology Area," *New York Times* October 30, 1983, p. 33. For a summary of the history regarding groundwater contamination, see @colten1991contamination.] The water in the aquifers remain unusable today.

I argue that to understand water and its relationship to Silicon Valley we can examine three contested landscapes in the Bay Area: natural, suburban, and industrial. Contests over water took place within competing landscapes in California. The Bay Area -- indeed, much of the American West -- experiences hybrid landscapes that reveal a cultural ideology that accepts conflicting uses for natural resources. Through examining these three hybrid landscapes that express the different ways people constructed different water use programs for human cultural and economic needs, I argue the underlying and conflicting interconnectedness of these landscapes has exacted significant costs from the Bay Area's human population and natural ecology. The story told here stands at the intersections of postindustrial society, environmental history, and the spatial politics of suburbanization and economic development.^[In his classic work, *Coming of the Post-Industrial Society*, sociologist Daniel Bell argued that the shift from a goods-producing economy to a service-based economy, the rise of a professional and technical class, the centrality of knowledge as the source of innovation, and the creation of intellectual technology embodied the postindustrial economy. Economic well-being was measured by quality of life measured by services and amenities rather than the quality of goods. Historian Hal Rothman, economist Thomas Michael Power, and geographer William Wyckoff have explored the larger ramifications of this shift in the American West. See @bell1999coming, 14; @rothman1997devils, 17; @power1996lostlandscapes; @wyckoff1995postindustrial.]

The conceptual underpinnings of the dissertation are about cultural perceptions of landscape. Landscape is the physical result of people constructing places for diverse purposes. Landscape is also a way of seeing the land, a perspective that emphasizes aspects of the geography that appeal to beauty, economy, or culture. Sand dunes, for example, once obstacles to travel, are now playgrounds for off-road enthusiasts. Landscapes are created both physically and mentally according to our preferences and experiences. In turn, these expectations shape and reshape the environment. The result is what Richard White has called a hybrid landscape, a landscape not purely wild or built but instead a construction of natural and cultural systems that shape and create place.[@white2004hybrid. In surveying the trends in environmental history, Richard White reviewed the works of several environmental historians including Josephy Taylor, Mark Fiege, Nancy Langston, and William DeBuys, who reject any hard division between culture and natural. Instead, they examine how forces shape and inform landscapes. Kenneth Olwig has argued that landscape is substantive, where "environment, economics, law, and culture are all important," and symbolic, "to be perceived, read, and interpreted on the ground, in written texts, and through artistic images." @sauer2008morphology, p. 100; @olwig1996recovering, p. 645; @meinig1979beholding, pp. 43--45; @basso1996wisdom, p. 110. William Cronon has argued the same phenomenon happens when Americans construct and then preserve wilderness to suit ideas of sublime nature while disregarding less-striking landscapes. See @cronon1996troublewilderness.] Geographer John Wright has argued that "places are best seen as shifting stages where the exercise of power and resistance to it vie for dominance."[@wright2003musculature, p. 85.] Physical and conceptual boundaries were drawn around natural, urban, and industrial landscapes in the Bay Area. These intermixed landscapes placed unique but concurrent pressures on water resources in the Bay Area, introducing ramifications not only at the local and state level but also the national level. Although this study is tightly focused on a specific region, it has greater bearing on understanding the inherent tension between local and national politics and Americans' growing awareness of environmental issues. In the Santa Clara Valley, the changing water landscape, resulting from various perceptions about nature, suburbs, and industry, shaped the use of water in the Valley.

The growth of Silicon Valley occurred upon some of California's most fertile lands. A survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in the 1930s in designated 154 square miles -- 32 percent -- of Santa Clara County as Class 1 land, the highest ranking possible for the cultivation of fruits and vegetables. Water systems fed into the valley, supplied by streams flowing down to the San Francisco Bay from the Diablo Range and Santa Cruz Mountains that carved out alluvial fans in the Valley. Below topsoil loam -- in some places measuring 40 feet deep -- are gravel and clay and freshwater aquifers, which nineteenth century farmers reached with artesian wells that provided a consistent supply of water.[@sachs1999ecology, p. 15.] Agricultural activity by the 1940s numbered around 6,000 farms in the Valley, mostly family-run operations, that totaled around 132,000 acres and some eight million cherry, apricot, and pear trees.[@sachs1999ecology, p. 16.]

By the 1970s, the water situation had changed in the Valley. What was once seemingly abundant had become scarce under the twin demands of urban growth and industrial development. Computer chip manufacturing is a highly water-intensive industry. An analyst for Texas Instruments estimated in the 1980s that creating a single 15-centimeter silicon wafer (used as the basis of electronic chips) required 8,610 liters of water in the manufacturing process.[@sachs1999ecology, p. 16.] Chip manufacturing in 2013 requires even greater amounts of water, including the use of an ultra-purified water used as a cleaning agent created from regular municipal water. This ultraclean water is unhealthy for human consumption, akin to poison; it's so efficient that it will leach minerals directly from human tissue.^[@fishman2011thirst pp. 47-48. Given the incredibly small scale of chip manufacturing, chip makers cannot risk minerals and particles in water damaging soldering. Hence, ultra pure water is used to wash away any potential particles. Industrial manufacturers were seeking out ultra pure water as early as 1961. See "More Pure Water Due for Industry," *New York Times*, January 9, 1961.] Urban development likewise placed new pressure on water as residents demanded access for their day to day lives, for their lawns, and for recreation. The combination of intense water usage by industry and the need to support suburban communities meant by the 1970s, for the first time, the county needed to start importing water.

Postwar prosperity encouraged widespread growth across the country. By the 1950s many American cities experienced widespread growth, but what was initially seen as a fulfillment of the American dream of homeownership became viewed as an environmental disaster. Critics took aim at suburban growth and environmental destruction, and nowhere was this change more obvious than in the West. Metropolitan growth doubled the population in the region between 1940 and 1960. Many westerners were unsettled by population growth, and raised concerns about the disappearance of rural landscapes being replaced by sprawl.^[On the emergence of sprawl in the Bay Area, see @walker2001industry; @omara2005cities, pp. 57--94.] Western political leaders such as Oregon Governor Thomas McCall condemned what he called "sagebrush suburbs" and sought limits on urban growth in the state. Anti-growth and environmental sentiments lay behind California voters rejecting damming plans to the Central Valley Water Project in the 1960s, opposition to the Peripheral Canal project in the 1970s, and the 1980 legal battles with technology companies regarding groundwater contamination. By the 1980s, the region was among the fastest growing in the nation.[On environmental concerns over suburbanization see: @jackson1985crabgrass; @rome2001bulldozer.]

The urban expansion of the Bay Area and its demands for water resources coincided with the growing environmental movement in America. Beginning in the 1960s, environmental groups like Sierra Club became politically active. The Wilderness Act of 1964 likewise brought greater attention to the nation's environmental issues. By the late 1960s, the environmental movement had become "a mass movement organized around cleaner air and water for all, not just in wilderness areas."[@steinberg2002earth, p. 240.] Books about the environment became best sellers, notably Rachel Carlson's *Silent Spring* and Paul and Anne Ehrlich's *The Population Bomb*. Other legislative actions, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, reflected growing concerns over environmental issues.[@hays1987beauty, pp. 13--39; @opie1998nature, pp. 404--433; @rothman2000saving, pp. 131-159; @steinberg2002earth, pp. 250--257.] Despite Lenihan's claim of the environmental movement's absence, the movement was indeed active in the Valley and expressed itself not only through advocacy groups but through California voters who rejected new large-scale water projects, urban development programs, and industrial growth plans that were not sensitive to ecological concerns.

# Organization

The dissertation is organized chronologically and thematically. Each chapter is roughly chronological to one another, but thematic in their narrative to explore the Valley's relationship to western water.

## Chapter 1: The Valley of Heart's Delight: The Natural-Suburban-Industrial Landscapes

Chapter 1 will set the stage for the mid-twentieth century. The chapter will begin by sketching out the three hybrid landscapes that existed in California: the agricultural landscape, the urban landscape, and the industrial landscape. As noted above, these landscapes were conceptual and physical constructions. The chapter will also introduce readers to the history leading up postwar California, and lay the groundwork found in agriculture, mining, and timbering operations that demanded large amounts of water. The chapter will largely be a general look at water in California prior to 1945. Chapter 2 will start a more focused examination of the Valley's history. The rest of the chapter lays out the rest of the groundwork by surveying urban growth and industrial growth, charting the rise of electronics manufacturing in Santa Clara County beginning in the early twentieth century and will end after World War II. This will be key to examining the early industrial work being built up by Stanford University. Chapter 1 brings the story up to the post-agricultural, postwar suburban and industrial development, which will be the primary focus of this dissertation. 

## Chapter 2: "Carved from a Forest of Fruit Trees": Suburbs and the Water Landscape

Joe Ruscigno, a lifetime farmer and resident of San Jose, started a new occupation in 1952. "Guess I've pulled out 150 acres of trees since the first of the year," he told the *San Francisco Chronicle*. Ruscigno lamented the uprooting of the prune trees to the bulldozer he now sat upon, but "what can you do? . . . The subdivisions were coming in all around us and when they made a good offer I sold out."^["Santa Clara County -- Scene of the Big Boom," *San Francisco Chronicle*, May 11, 1952.] Chapter 3 builds chronologically from the previous chapters and extends the story into the postwar years. The chapter will focus primarily on urban growth between 1945 and 1965, and examine how new residents attempted to exert changes upon water resources in order to support the growing cities. To keep the story focused, the chapter will use the city of San Jose as a case study. San Jose exemplified changes occurring in other Peninsula cities and will examine urban growth and its encroachment upon natural water features and new demands on municipal water supplies. 

## Chapter 3: Machines in the Garden: The Stanford Start-Ups

Beginning in the mid-1950s, Stanford began attracting high technology industry to the Stanford Industrial Park, established to promote research and developments of electronics. Built primarily on the backs of defense contracts, the Park became a hub of intellectual and manufacturing activity and kicked off a wave of new industrial growth that spread south through Santa Clara Valley. Just as suburban homes demanded new amenities for lawns and recreation, so did businesses require water for aesthetics and production. The construction of business parks also meant bulldozing under wetlands, flood plains, and creeks to make room for development. The chapter will explore residents and city leaders attitudes towards urban growth and the role played by industry in promoting that growth.

## Chapter 4: How Clean is Clean? Water and the Myth of Clean Industry

High technology manufacturing billed itself as a "clean" industry, in contrast to the smokestacks of the Midwest and Northeast industrial belt. Businesses sought to promote this image in their very architectural design, shaping industrial parks into apparent open spaces dotted with trees and lawns. In 1983, responding to the discovery of chemical contamination of ground water from semiconductor industries, the Environmental Protection Agency announced plans for a $500,000 study of Silicon Valley to examine the effects of industrial pollution.^["U.S. to study Pollution in High-Technology Area," *New York Times* October 30, 1983, p. 33; "High-Tech: A Stain on a 'Clean' Field," *Los Angeles Times* December 22, 1983, pp. 14, 18.] The issue sparked a debate about the cleanliness of water, but also bled into broader discussions about the value of industry's presence in the Valley. This chapter will explore local efforts to curb industrial growth and allow me to examine how residents thought about their environment.   

## Chapter 5: The End of the Boom

Finally, the final chapter will examine the events and causes of new water conservation policies for residential communities. I argue that the changing economic and regulatory conditions facing suburbs led to a period of new conservation policies and local political measures. Local eco-justice groups -- the Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition (SVTC), GrassRoots Recycling Network, Mercury Policy Project, and Clean Water Action -- pressured industry and urban policies to account for environmental negligence and the impact its had on land and water. The final chapter will examine how these local politics were implemented, and how city leaders responded to political pressures. Such measures included ending the recruitment of new industry to the area, beginning in 1970 when the County Chamber of Commerce's $147,000 budget was slashed in half by the city Board of Supervisors.^["The End of a California Dream? Santa Clara County Tries to Put the Brakes on New Industry and Population," *Los Angeles Times* July 31, 1970, p. 1.]. The final chapter will end in the 1990s before the dot-com bubble shifts the focus of the electronics industry to networked computers.

## Sources

Reconceptualizing the dissertation has led me to a much more focused and clear set of primary sources to consult.

### Local newspaper accounts.  

Local newspapers will form an important core of primary source material, allowing me to gauge local sentiments regarding environment, industry, and urban growth through editorials, news stories, and opinion pieces. In particular, the bulk of the research will be in the *Palo Alto Times* and the *San Jose Mercury*, two of the county's largest newspapers in terms of circulation. Stanford University owns microfilm collections of each paper for the years I need, between 1950 and 1990. 

### Don Edwards Congressional Papers.

Don Edwards (Democrat) served as Santa Clara County's Representative between 1963 and 1995. His congressional papers are housed at San Jose State University and contain several records relating to water projects, environmental issues, and urban and industrial growth. In particular, the Edwards Papers contains records on large state water projects, correspondence with environmental activists, and legislative activity. Edward also served on the Congressional panel investigating the Fairchild toxic leak. Cursory examinations of his papers so far include material relating to state water projects, Bureau of Reclamations correspondence, groundwater contamination hearings, urban renewal projects, and correspondence with local residents regarding environmental issues. The Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge was named to honor his work on environmental issues in the Bay Area.

### Alfred E. Alquist Papers.

Alfred Alquist (Democrat) served in the California State Assembly and the State Senate for over thirty years. He is best known for his co-authorship of the 1974 law creating the California Energy Commission and gained a reputation for representing the poor and labor in the state. His records, housed at San Jose State University, contain records relating to the Santa Clara Water District in the 1970s and the Peripheral Canal in the 1980s.  

### Silicon Valley Toxics Coalition Papers.

The SVTC Papers at San Jose State University contain material related to groundwater cleanup in the 1980s and 1990s, including records on research conducted by the organization, records on businesses, correspondence with the City of San Jose Environmental Committee, public relations and correspondence records, and public/transcribed talks. 

### William J. O'Connell Papers. 

William J. O'Connell served as an industrial engineer and worked with the Division of Engineering and Irrigation for California Public Works. O'Connell began his career in the 1920s working on state water projects, but later began his own consultant company and advised several Bay Area cities on water rights, irrigation, sewage, water quality control, recreational uses for water, and fisheries and cannery resources. Especially useful for my project will be records relating to news clippings related to urban sprawl and industrial development, records on industrial waste (correspondence, reports, news clippings), and urban sprawl (clippings, reports, correspondence).  

### Richard Lyman Papers.

Richard Lyman was Stanford University's seventh president, serving from September 1970 to the summer of 1980. He first came to Stanford in 1958, where he taught in the history department. Lyman's papers, housed at Stanford University, include correspondence with the City of Palo Alto, records relating to Stanford Industrial Park, and material regarding water requirements and resources. The bulk of these records are between 1959 and 1969. 

### Harvey O. Banks Papers.

Harvey O. Banks was a civil engineer who was appointed the first director of the new California Department of Water Resources in 1956. Banks oversaw most of the legislation and development of the California State Water Project. His papers are housed at the University of California-Riverside. Specific records exist for the Santa Clara Valley Water District, including correspondence, reports, maps for proposed facilities, Corps of Engineers reports on industrial water usage, and meeting minutes. The bulk of the records are between 1970 and 1990.

### Erwin Cooper Papers.

Erwin Cooper served as the information officer for the California Department of Water Resources. The bulk of the records are from 1950 to 1965 and contain press releases, speeches, news clippings, reports, and photographs regarding California water development. Specific records exist relating to water resources and industrial development, urban encroachment onto rural lands, and public speeches regarding water plans in the Bay Area.

### Glenna Matthews Oral History Collection.

Glenna Matthews, a historian who authored *Silicon Valley, Women, and the California Dream: Gender, Class, and Opportunity in the Twentieth Century* (2003), conducted several oral history interviews for her research. Although much of her work primarily focused on gender and labor in Silicon Valley, some of the interviews may have relevance to my work on environmental history. Especially important to my work would be the interviews with Sig Sanchez (director of the Santa Clara Valley Water District) and Ted Smith (founder of SVTC). 

### Oral histories.

I've begun making contact with some environmental activists in the Bay Area who are interested in the project and seem eager to share their stories. I am hoping the interviews will help me branch out the research to others who were either involved in environmental activism, but also pull in industrial or government workers who likewise shared concerns about water resources (their use, access, or protection).
