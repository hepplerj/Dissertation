\begin{aquote}{\textit{Time}, November 18, 1991}
If America is the land were the world goes in search of miracles and redemption, California is the land where Americans go.

At the end of 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a town hall meeting in Sunnyvale. The topic: indoor air quality testing of homes. The EPA planned to test homes and a nearby school for the presence of trichloroethene (TCE) dispersed into the air from evaporating contaminated groundwater, a process known as "vapor intrusion."^["Sunnyvale: EPA plans on testing indoor air quality for vapor intrusion," *San Jose Mercury News*, December 5, 2014 <http://www.mercurynews.com/my-town/ci_27080114/sunnyvale-epa-plans-testing-indoor-air-quality-vapor>.] The area, known as the Triple Site under monitoring by the EPA, were the remediated Superfund sites of AMD Electronics, TRW Microwave, and Philips Semiconductors.^[More about the Triple Sites can be found at <http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dec8ba3252368428825742600743733/d18e8a81d96408d588257d32005da7f0>.] The site was

The conflict over the landscapes is barely perceptible on the landscape of the Santa Clara County, but they can be discerned if you look closely. Historical highways signs, fenced-off military installations, protected wilderness areas, capped wells, and the small, white PVC pipes occasionally dotting the manicured lawns of businesses that allows for the evaporation chemical contaminants into the air. 

In 1980, one resident worried about Silicon Valley's place in American culture: "If this area has that much influence on our ideologies and our philosophies and our way of life, God help us."^[Haynes Johnson, "The Perils of Paradise," *Washington Post*, October 19, 1980.]
