\begin{aquote}{\textit{Time}, November 18, 1991}
If America is the land were the world goes in search of miracles and redemption, California is the land where Americans go. It is America's America, the symbol of raw hope and brave (even foolish) invention, where ancient traditions and inhibitions are abandoned at the border. Its peculiar culture squirts out---on film and menus and pages and television beams---the trends and tastes that sweep the rest of the country.

The Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation anticipated little opposition to
their plans to build the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library on the campus of
Stanford University. Coupled with the Hoover Institution, whose officials
advised Reagan and shared his conservative outlook, the selection of Stanford
University for the presidential library, museum, and public affairs research
center seemed like a natural fit. The Spanish-mission style architecture
designed by Hugh A. Stubbins Jr., would nestle in the hills above the
university and administratively housed under the Hoover Institution. Yet when
Stanford's Board of Trustees approved the plan in February 1984, the outcry was
swift. Faculty and students objected to the library's presence, fearing it
would only serve to "politicize" Stanford.

Critics of the Reagan Library also couched their argument in the environment.
Place mattered to the critics. The Reagan Foundation hoped to situate the
presidential library in the foothills on unincorporated Stanford property next
to the Center for Advanced Study in Behavioral Sciences, a decision locals and
university members criticized. "They want to put it on one of the last
undeveloped hills in the community," Samuel Brain, a senior researcher in
Stanford's radiology department and a vocal critic of the plan told the *New
York Times*. "There are a lot of people who are attached to that hill, and they
don't want it ruined." Furthermore, Palo Alto residents worried about the
potential of tourists flooding their town with traffic and tourism
upsetting the hill's seclusion.[^4]

The debate over land use in Palo Alto reflected a longer debate about western
land use, and specifically about the presence of natural places near urban
areas. Richard White's observation about the West's public lands---that "land
cannot be simultaneously range, parking lots, and wilderness"---applies to
Santa Clara County.[^5] People give spaces definition through cultural
processes that determine how land and space should be utilized for economics,
shelter, food, and transportation. Yet there are few times when these spaces
can become a member of more than one category of use. These are not necessarily
historical realities; they are cultural understandings of how particular places
are defined, used, and protected.

Silicon Valley is two types of places. The first conjures images of iPhones,
computers, Steve Jobs, maybe erroneously, Microsoft. This Silicon Valley is
a set of assumptions and attitudes defined by technology, invention,
innovation, venture funding, and capital revolving around high technology. But
Silicon Valley is also a place positioned in geographic space. These two views
into Silicon Valley---as a geographic place, and as a social
construction---illustrate how we can come to understand the Valley's spatial
history. People of the past attached meaning to place through lived experiences
and imagined geographies. When Samuel Brain criticized the plans for the Reagan
Library, he was drawing from a history of people defining the Valley landscape
for specific purposes. Brain also encapsulated fifty years of land use debates
about whether land should be left in a "natural" state or put to some other
use.

In 2000, the Committee for Green Foothills helped organize a campaign against
the City of San Jose for plans to build a corporate research park in the Coyote
Valley for Cisco Systems. CGF helped create a grassroots organization called
People for Livable and Affordable Neighborhoods (PLAN), which initiated
a referendum campaign in an attempt to halt the campus's creation. CFG argued
that the Coyote Valley, located at the narrowing of the southern end of the
Santa Clara Valley, served an important agricultural purpose, was used by many
for recreation, and remained an important thoroughfare for wildlife crossing
between the Santa Cruz and Diablo ranges, as well as holding the distinction of
being the largest freshwater wetland in the county. While the referendum
managed to secure enough signatures to place a vote on the ballot, the City of
San Jose disallowed the petition on the grounds that the text of the referendum
was incorrect.^[The denial of the referendum petition has been charged by
environmentalists as a sign of corruption in San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales'
administration. Gonzales was a supporter of the project.] The collapse of the
dot-com boom in the early 2000s led Cisco to withdraw its plans. Debates over
the Coyote Valley continue between environmentalists and developers, where the
land is zoned for light industrial under San Jose's mid-1980s master plan. In
2015, environmentalists won what they hope will become a widespread move in the
Coyote Valley. A new 348-acre park called the Coyote Valley Open Space Preserve
opened in the summer. "There are 1.8 million people who have access to the last
vestiges of the Valley of Heart's Delight," Marc Landgraf, external affairs
manager of the Santa Clara County Open Space Authority, told the *San Jose
Mercury News*. "And we want to keep it that way."^["New park in Silicon Valley
opens Saturday, rekindling debate over future of Coyote Valley," *San Jose
Mercury News*, June 24, 2015.]

\thoughtbreak{At the end of 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency} announced a town hall meeting in Sunnyvale. The topic: indoor air quality testing of homes. The EPA planned to test homes and a nearby school for the presence of trichloroethene (TCE) dispersed into the air from evaporating contaminated groundwater, a process known as "vapor intrusion."^["Sunnyvale: EPA plans on testing indoor air quality for vapor intrusion," *San Jose Mercury News*, December 5, 2014 <http://www.mercurynews.com/my-town/ci_27080114/sunnyvale-epa-plans-testing-indoor-air-quality-vapor>.] The area, known as the Triple Site under monitoring by the EPA, were the remediated Superfund sites of AMD Electronics, TRW Microwave, and Philips Semiconductors.^[More about the Triple Sites can be found at <http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dec8ba3252368428825742600743733/d18e8a81d96408d588257d32005da7f0>.] Volatile organic compounds were discovered in 1981 leaking from storage tanks on company property at levels past acceptable standards. Should the EPA discovered vapor intrusion in homes or schools, they will assist in the installation of mitigation systems to filter and vent the air.^["EPA School Sampling Update," EPA Factsheet, August 2014 <http://sunnyvale.ca.gov/Portals/0/Sunnyvale/OCM/CMBlog/2014/Aug25/TripleSiteSchoolsAug2014.pdf>.]

The hazardous and toxic landscapes lived on in other areas of the Peninsula as well. In East Palo Alto, a group calling themselves Youth United for Community Action initiated a campaign against the Romic waste treatment facility, arguing that the facility's presence constituted environmental racism. YUCA claims that Romic has exacerbated risks of cancer and asthma for East Palo Alto, going so far as to conduct their own health surveys that found one-out-of-four 13-to-21 year-olds had asthma and that cancer rates were far higher than average for the rest of San Mateo County. A 2006 explosion that severely burned employee Frolian Chan-Liongco, a sudden Romic tanker chemical leak that released fifteen different chemicals, and decades of hazardous material stored on-site led activists to argue Romic was no longer welcome in their community. "Romic feels that since it is located in a community of color that they don't have to abide by regulations," argued Annie Loya, an activist with YUCA. "But also it is the regulatory system that is failing. The result is that there is a blind eye cast upon how businesses operate in communities like ours."^["Silicon Valley's Dirty Secret," *Metroactive*, January 3, 2007
<http://www.metroactive.com/metro/01.03.07/environmental-racism-0701.html>; "Waste-facility foes rally at City Hall," *San Jose Mercury News*, December 20, 2006.] In 2005, YUAC filed a federal civil rights suit against Romic claiming "environmental racism" against the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, claiming that DTSC allowed Romic to operate with an expired permit and failed to force the company to complete an environmental impact report.^["
State shuts down chemical plant," *The Daily Journal*, May 31, 2007.] A year later, the East Palo Alto City Council voted to appeal to the State to deny Romic an extension on its operating permit. That fall, San Mateo County officials made the same case, arguing that Romic constituted "great environmental and public health risks."^["
State shuts down chemical plant," *The Daily Journal*, May 31, 2007.] The state acted in 2007 when DTSC announced it yanked Romic's permit for handling and storing liquid waste after its investigation of environmental violations included the release of 4,000 solvents in June 2006 and two incidents of employees seriously burned in June 2004 and March 2006.

\thoughtbreak{These stories are products of the past}. During the postwar era, confrontations over the landscape gave expression to environmentalism in Santa Clara County. The conflicts over landscapes are barely perceptible on the landscape of Silicon Valley today, but they can be discerned if you look closely. Fenced-off military installations, protected wilderness areas, capped wells, and the small, white PVC pipes occasionally dotting the manicured lawns of businesses that allows for the evaporation chemical contaminants into the air serve as visible reminders of how the attitudes and desires of the Cold War altered the land, water, and air. 

Environmentalism emerging out of the suburbs shaped cities. The narrative of suburbanization and city-building in postwar America often posits the ways that nature is threatened by cities. While city boosters sought to expand their municipal boundaries, suburbanites reacted fiercely when the natural amenities they had come to enjoy were threatened. Hill regrades, channeled creeks, and high traffic roads became visible expressions of landscape changes that threatened the aesthetic amenities suburbanites had come to enjoy. The shape of the Valley's cities, in other words, were shaped by suburban desires for nature. Common nature writing assumes that nature exists outside of cities and suburbs, that little of nature can be found among housing tracts. Instead, nature exists elsewhere beyond cities, couched as a dichotomous relationship of "wilderness" and "city." Viewed this way, nature occupies special areas---places we call "national parks," "open spaces," and "wilderness areas." But such places also existed in suburbia, not as a plot of land bounded by the dimensions of a "park," but by the suburban countryside that so many desired to live among.

But in the process of shaping the city and countryside, middle- and upper-class environmentalists relied upon or crafted peculiar narratives about their landscapes that often biased their views of nature. Socioeconomic, class, racial, and spatial boundaries determined where suburbanites looked for nature. That nature, more often than not, existed on the hillsides and in their backyards. The suburban countryside formed the core of their motivations, leaning on an aesthetic ideal and agricultural mythos to argue for placing limits on growth and protecting particular spaces. Among minority populations in Silicon Valley, environment represented something else: rather than aesthetics and recreation, their pursuit of an environmental agenda grounded itself in health, housing, and access to livable metropolitan spaces. To be sure, by the 1990s environmentalists could claim their efforts a success through the legal efforts to protect the natural resources of the Bay Area Thousands of acres of protected open space exist mostly among the foothills of the Santa Cruz and Diablo ranges. 

But in Silicon Valley, as in much of the American West, remarkable economic growth was accompanied by social and environmental costs. The decade-long battles over open space, farmland preservation, and toxics contamination were significant challenges for federal, state, county, and local agencies to manage as people pressured for protection, access, and cleanup of these lands. Pressures for growth and preservation continue to collide in places like Coyote Valley and East Palo Alto as debates about environmental health, air pollution, and wildlife shape public discourse. While high tech manufacturing continues to cultivate an image of clean and green---from Google's touting of it's solar-panel-roofed buildings to Apple's environmental reports on its server farms, while those with the means drive Priuses and Teslas---pressure for growth will lead to future controversies over the environmental costs of high tech industrialization and urban development on the western landscape.
