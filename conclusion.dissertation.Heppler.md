\begin{aquote}{\textit{Time}, November 18, 1991}
If America is the land were the world goes in search of miracles and redemption, California is the land where Americans go. It is Americaâ€™s America, the symbol of raw hope and brave (even foolish) invention, where ancient traditions and inhibitions are abandoned at the border. Its peculiar culture squirts out---on film and menus and pages and television beams---the trends and tastes that sweep the rest of the country.
\end{aquote}

\begin{aquote}{Louis Simpson}
O God, O California! There was probably no place in the world that had better scenery, and there was no sadder place in the world either. Here were all the disconnected people---farmers from Iowa who had lived in mud and now wanted only to doze in the sunshine; young women from Brooklyn with warts, whose politics were purely revenge; the children of swimming-pools in La Jolla and tennis courts in Connecticut. At night across the Bay the lights of Fairyland twinkled and beckoned. Here came all the lost people, to the end of America where there is nowhere to go but out of your mind.

In 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency announced a town hall meeting in Sunnyvale. The topic: indoor air quality testing of homes. The EPA planned to test homes for the presence of trichloroethene (TCE) dispersed into the air from evaporating contaminated groundwater, a process known as "vapor intrusion."^["Sunnyvale: EPA plans on testing indoor air quality for vapor intrusion," *San Jose Mercury News*, December 5, 2014 <http://www.mercurynews.com/my-town/ci_27080114/sunnyvale-epa-plans-testing-indoor-air-quality-vapor>.] The area, known as the Triple Site, under monitoring by the EPA were remediated Superfund sites of AMD Electronics, TRW Microwave, and Philips Semiconductors.^[More about the Triple Sites can be found at <http://yosemite.epa.gov/r9/sfund/r9sfdocw.nsf/3dec8ba3252368428825742600743733/d18e8a81d96408d588257d32005da7f0>.]

The conflict over the landscapes is barely perceptible on the landscape of the Santa Clara County, but they can be discerned if you look closely. Historical highways signs, fenced-off military installations, protected wilderness areas, and the small, white PVC pipes occasionally dotting the land that allows soil to evaporate chemical contaminants into the air. 

In 1980, one resident worried about Silicon Valley's place in American culture: "If this area has that much influence on our ideologies and our philosophies and our way of life, God help us."^[Haynes Johnson, "The Perils of Paradise," *Washington Post*, October 19, 1980.]
